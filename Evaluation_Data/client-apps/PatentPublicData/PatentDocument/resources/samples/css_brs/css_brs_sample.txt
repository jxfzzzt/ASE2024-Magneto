      thereof, the apparatus 100 may comprise at least one portion (e.g. a
      portion or all) of an electronic device. For example, the apparatus 100
      may comprise a portion of the electronic device mentioned above, and more
      particularly, can be a control circuit such as a chipset comprising one
      or more integrated circuits (ICs) within the electronic device. In
      another example, the apparatus 100 can be the whole of the electronic
      device mentioned above. In another example, the apparatus 100 can be an
      audio/video system comprising the electronic device mentioned above.

      assistant (PDA), a portable electronic device such as the so-called
      tablet, and a personal computer such as a laptop computer or desktop
      computer.
DETX  According to this embodiment, the apparatus 100 may comprise at least one
      chip of the electronic device, and may further comprise at least one EMI
      suppression circuit integrated into the at least one chip of the
      electronic device. As shown in FIG. 1, in addition to the chip 10, the
      aforementioned at least one chip of the electronic device comprises the
      chip 110, and the aforementioned at least one EMI suppression circuit
      integrated into the aforementioned at least one chip comprises the EMI
      suppression circuit 112 (labeled "SC" in FIG. 1, for brevity, where "SC"
      stands for "suppression circuit"). In addition, the aforementioned at
      least one EMI suppression circuit (e.g. the EMI suppression circuit 112)
      is arranged to perform EMI reduction on at least one signal within the
      aforementioned at least one chip (e.g. at least one signal within the
      chip 110). Additionally, the bus shown in FIG. 1 is arranged to
      electrically connect the chip 10 and the chip 110, where the
      aforementioned at least one EMI suppression circuit (e.g. the EMI
      suppression circuit 112) is positioned within the aforementioned at least
      one chip such as the chip 110, rather than being positioned on the bus
      shown in FIG. 1. This is for illustrative purposes only, and is not meant
      to be a limitation of the present invention. According to some variations
      of this embodiment, the aforementioned at least one EMI suppression
      circuit may comprise multiple EMI suppression circuits, and/or the
      aforementioned at least one chip may comprise multiple chips. For
      example, the at least one chip may comprise a first chip (e.g. the chip
      110) and a second chip (which differs from the chip 10), and the
      aforementioned at least one EMI suppression circuit may comprise a first
      EMI suppression circuit (e.g. the EMI suppression circuit 112) positioned
      within the first chip (e.g. the chip 110), and further comprises a second
      EMI suppression circuit (e.g. a copy of the EMI suppression circuit 112,
      or a variant thereof) positioned within the second chip. In another
      example, the aforementioned at least one chip may comprise a first chip
      (e.g. the chip 110), and the aforementioned at least one EMI suppression
      circuit may comprise a first EMI suppression circuit (e.g. the EMI
      suppression circuit 112) positioned within the first chip (e.g. the chip
      110), and may further comprise a second EMI suppression circuit (e.g. a
      copy of the EMI suppression circuit 112, or a variant thereof) positioned
      within the first chip (e.g. the chip 110).
DETX  FIG. 2 illustrates a flowchart of a method 200 for performing chip level
      EMI reduction according to an embodiment of the present invention. The
      method shown in FIG. 2 can be applied to the apparatus 100 shown in FIG.
      1, and can be applied to the apparatus 100 of any of the above-disclosed
      variations of the first embodiments. The method is described as follows.
DETX  In Step 210, the apparatus 100 provides at least one EMI suppression
      circuit within at least one chip of the electronic device. For example,
      the aforementioned at least one EMI suppression circuit in the first
      embodiment can be taken as an example of the at least one EMI suppression
      circuit mentioned in Step 210, and the aforementioned at least one chip
      in the first embodiment can be taken as an example of the at least one
      chip mentioned in Step 210. In some other examples, the aforementioned at
      least one EMI suppression circuit may comprise multiple EMI suppression
      circuits, and/or the aforementioned at least one chip may comprise
      multiple chips.
DETX  In Step 220, the apparatus 100 utilizes the at least one EMI suppression
      circuit within the at least one chip to perform EMI reduction on at least
      one signal within the at least one chip, whereby radiation of at least
      one signal path outside the at least one chip is reduced. For example, in
      a situation where the aforementioned at least one EMI suppression circuit
      in the first embodiment is taken as an example of the at least one EMI
      suppression circuit mentioned in Step 210 and the aforementioned at least
      one chip in the first embodiment is taken as an example of the at least
      one chip mentioned in Step 210, the aforementioned at least one signal in
      the first embodiment can be taken as an example of the at least one
      signal mentioned in Step 210. In some other examples, in a situation
      where the aforementioned at least one EMI suppression circuit comprises
      multiple EMI suppression circuits and/or the aforementioned at least one
      chip comprises multiple chips, the aforementioned at least one signal may
      comprise multiple signals within the aforementioned at least one chip.
DETX  According to this embodiment, the aforementioned at least one chip may
      comprise the first chip such as the chip 110, and the aforementioned at
      least one EMI suppression circuit may comprise the first EMI suppression
      circuit positioned within the first chip, such as the EMI suppression
      circuit 112. In a situation where the aforementioned at least one signal
      comprises a first signal within the first chip (e.g. the chip 110), the
      apparatus 100 typically utilizes the EMI suppression circuit (e.g. the
      EMI suppression circuit 112) positioned within the first chip (e.g. the
      chip 110) to perform EMI reduction on the first signal within the first
      chip. This is for illustrative purposes only, and is not meant to be a
      limitation of the present invention. As mentioned, the aforementioned at
      least one EMI suppression circuit may comprise multiple EMI suppression
      circuits, and/or the aforementioned at least one chip may comprise
      multiple chips. For example, in a situation where the aforementioned at
      least one chip further comprises the aforementioned second chip (which
      differs from the chip 10) and the aforementioned at least one EMI
      suppression circuit further comprises the aforementioned second EMI
      suppression circuit (e.g. a copy of the EMI suppression circuit 112, or a
      variant thereof) positioned within the second chip, the aforementioned at
      least one signal comprises the first signal within the first chip and
      further comprises a second signal within the second chip, and the
      apparatus 100 utilizes the first EMI suppression circuit positioned
      within the first chip to perform EMI reduction on the first signal within
      the first chip and further utilizes the second EMI suppression circuit
      positioned within the second chip to perform EMI reduction on the second
      signal within the second chip. In another example, in a situation where
      the aforementioned at least one EMI suppression circuit further comprises
      the aforementioned second EMI suppression circuit (e.g. a copy of the EMI
      suppression circuit 112, or a variant thereof) positioned within the
      first chip (e.g. the chip 110), the aforementioned at least one signal
      comprises the first signal within the first chip and further comprises a
      second signal within the first chip, and the apparatus 100 utilizes the
      first EMI suppression circuit positioned within the first chip to perform
      EMI reduction on the first signal within the first chip and further
      utilizes the second EMI suppression circuit positioned within the first
      chip to perform EMI reduction on the second signal within the first chip.
DETX  According to a variation of the embodiment shown in FIG. 2, the first EMI
      suppression circuit is electrically connected to an internal signal path
      of the first chip, where the internal signal path is coupled to an
      input/output (I/O) pad of the first chip. According to another variation
      of the embodiment shown in FIG. 2, at least one non-ground terminal of
      the first EMI suppression circuit is electrically connected to an
      internal signal path of the first chip, and at least one ground terminal
      of the first EMI suppression circuit is electrically connected to ground
      or virtual-ground of the first chip.
DETX  FIG. 3 illustrates some implementation details of the apparatus 100 shown
      in FIG. 1 according to an embodiment of the present invention. The chip
      110 comprises a digital circuit 300 comprising output buffers 301-1,
      301-2, . . . , and 301-N respectively receiving a main clock and some
      signals, and further comprises an I/O pad ring 310 comprising I/O pad
      modules 312-1, 312-2, . . . , and 312-N, where an I/O pad module 312-n
      within the I/O pad modules 312-1, 312-2, . . . , and 312-N (with the
      notation n representing an integer falling within the range of the
      interval [1, N] comprises an I/O pad unit 302-n and an EMI suppression
      circuit 112-n (labeled "SC" in FIG. 3), and the EMI suppression circuit
      112-1, 112-2, . . . , and 112-N can be taken as examples of the
      aforementioned at least one EMI suppression circuit. The curves
      illustrated between the I/O pad modules 312-1, 312-2, . . . , and 312-N
      of the chip 110 and the fingers 52-0, 52-1, 52-2, . . . , and 52-N
      positioned within the package 50 of the chip 110 represent bond wires. As
      the EMI suppression circuit 112-1, 112-2, . . . , and 112-N are within
      the chip 110, most harmonic components of the digital signals of the
      digital circuit 300 (e.g. most harmonic components of the main clock and
      the signals shown in FIG. 3) can be suppressed successfully. As a result
      of performing chip level EMI reduction by utilizing the aforementioned at
      least one EMI suppression circuit such as the EMI suppression circuit
      112-1, 112-2, . . . , and 112-N are within the chip 110, it is
      unnecessary to implement with the aforementioned EMI solutions of the
      related art, and therefore, the related art problems can be prevented.
DETX  FIG. 4 illustrates some radiation problems that may occur in a situation
      where the EMI suppression circuits 112-1, 112-2, . . . , and 112-N shown
      in FIG. 3 are temporarily disabled (as if they are not implemented within
      the chip 110) according to an embodiment of the present invention. For
      example, the EMI suppression circuits 112-1, 112-2, . . . , and 112-N of
      this embodiment may be temporarily disabled by utilizing some switching
      units that can electrically disconnect the EMI suppression circuits
      112-1, 112-2, . . . , and 112-N from other portions within the chip 110.
      The digital chip shown in FIG. 4 may represent the combination of the
      chip 110 and the package 50 shown in FIG. 3 except that the EMI
      suppression circuits 112-1, 112-2, . . . , and 112-N shown in FIG. 3 are
      temporarily disabled. In addition, the printed circuit board (PCB) shown
      in FIG. 4 may represent the PCB where the digital chip shown in FIG. 4 is
      mounted, where the notation "RF ANT" stands for antenna of the radio

CRTX CLAIM OF PRIORITY
CRTX  The present application claims priority from, and is a divisional
      application of, U.S. patent application Ser. No. 13/303,416, filed Nov.

      2010, the contents of each of which are incorporated by reference herein
      in their entirety.
BSTX FIELD OF THE DISCLOSURE
BSTX  The present disclosure is generally related to apparatus, systems and
      methods for electronic device protection.
BSTX BACKGROUND
BSTX  Low-noise amplifiers in antennas and direction arrival estimation systems
      may be susceptible to high-power microwave attacks or interference from
      other devices located near the low-noise amplifiers. In phased array
      antenna systems and certain other communication systems, silicon carbide
      (SiC)-based limiters may be placed in-line to provide protection against
      high-power signals. For example, the SiC-based limiters may be placed
      between an antenna and the low-noise amplifiers to reduce the amount of
      power that goes through the low-noise amplifiers. The SiC-based limiters
      may be integrated at each element of a phased array antenna. Since phased
      array antennas may include thousands of elements, placing limiters at
      each element may introduce significant costs and complexity.
BSTX  Another method of protecting electronic devices, such as low-noise
      amplifiers, from exposure to high-power electromagnetic radiation, e.g.,
      high-power microwave radiation, may be to place a switchable
      transistorized mesh system in front of an antenna array. The switchable
      transistorized mesh system may include conductors arranged in a mesh with
      discontinuities. A transistor may be present at each discontinuity. When
      the transistors are off (e.g., behaving like an open switch),
      electromagnetic energy may pass through the mesh. When the transistors
      are on (e.g., behaving like a closed switch), the mesh is effectively
      continuous, and electromagnetic energy may be reflected from the mesh.
      Since each transistor is provided with power for switching, significant
      complexity may be added by using such a switchable transistorized mesh
      system. Further, switching time of the transistors may add an
      unacceptable delay.
BSTX SUMMARY
BSTX  Apparatus, systems and methods for electronic device protection are
      provided. A particular apparatus includes a non-conductive substrate and
      a plurality of cells including conductive members coupled to the
      non-conductive substrate. The conductive members are arranged to form a
      first discontinuous mesh. Regions between the conductive members of the
      first discontinuous mesh include a phase change material. The phase
      change material undergoes a phase transition from substantially
      non-conductive to substantially conductive responsive to a change of
      energy.
BSTX  A particular system includes an electronic device and a protection
      apparatus to protect the electronic device by selectively blocking
      electromagnetic radiation. The protective apparatus includes a
      non-conductive substrate and a plurality of cells including conductive
      members coupled to the non-conductive substrate. The conductive members
      are arranged to form a first discontinuous mesh. Regions between the
      conductive members of the first discontinuous mesh include a phase change
      material. The phase change material undergoes a phase transition from
      substantially non-conductive to substantially conductive responsive to a
      first electromagnetic waveform.
BSTX  A particular method includes permitting a first signal having a first
      electromagnetic waveform to pass through an apparatus and blocking a
      second signal having a second electromagnetic waveform at the apparatus.
      The second electromagnetic waveform is different than the first
      electromagnetic waveform. The apparatus includes a non-conductive
      substrate, a discontinuous mesh of conductive members, and a phase change
      material disposed between the conductive members of the discontinuous
      mesh. The phase change material undergoes a phase transition from
      substantially non-conductive to substantially conductive at least
      partially responsive to the second electromagnetic waveform.
BSTX  The features, functions, and advantages that have been described can be
      achieved independently in various embodiments or may be combined in yet
      other embodiments, further details of which are disclosed with reference
      to the following description and drawings, which are not to scale.

DETX DETAILED DESCRIPTION
DETX  Embodiments disclosed herein include an inexpensive low-loss,
      wide-bandwidth, radio frequency (RF) shutter for use in protecting
      electronic devices, such as low-noise amplifiers and other communication
      systems. The RF shutter may include conductive elements arranged in a
      mesh. The conductive elements of the mesh may have a plurality of
      intersections. The conductive elements may be separated by a gap or a
      phase change material. For example, an area between the conductive
      elements may include discontinuities formed by a phase change material or
      phase change materials. The phase change material may be substantially
      non-conductive in a first phase and substantially conductive in a second
      phase. As used herein, a substantially non-conductive material refers to
      a material that has few mobile charge carriers, such as an insulator or
      dielectric. Thus, a substantially non-conductive material has a high
      dielectric constant. In contrast, a substantially conductive material
      herein refers to a material with an abundance of moveable charge
      carriers, such as a metal or plasma. To illustrate, the phase change
      material may be a material such as vanadium dioxide, which undergoes a
      metal-insulator phase transition. In another example, the phase change
      material may be a gas that undergoes a gas-to-plasma phase transition.
      The phase transition from the first phase to the second phase may be
      triggered responsive to particular electromagnetic waveforms.
DETX  The discontinuities between the conductive elements enable the
      discontinuous mesh to be transparent to certain electromagnetic waves
      (e.g., relatively low-power, low-frequency signals). However, in the
      presence of other electromagnetic waves (e.g., relatively high-power or
      high-frequency signals), the phase change material in the discontinuities
      may become conductive. For example, a gas in microgaps between the
      conductive elements may form a plasma. The plasma is conductive and
      electrically bridges the microgap causing the mesh to behave as a
      continuous mesh and to reflect the electromagnetic waves. In another
      example, an insulator-metal phase change material between the conductive
      elements may undergo a phase transition from an insulator (i.e.,
      substantially nonconductive) phase to a metal (i.e., substantially
      conductive) phase, thereby electrically bridging the conductive elements.
DETX  In a particular embodiment, when a plasma is formed between the
      conductive elements, the plasma may be a cold plasma. A cold plasma may
      be only partially ionized. For example, in a cold plasma as little as
      about 1% of a gas may be ionized. This is in contrast to a thermal or hot
      plasma, in which a much higher proportion of the gas may be ionized. When
      an insulator-metal phase change material is used, the insulator-metal
      phase change material may include a dopant or other material that changes
      phase transition properties of the insulator-metal phase change material.
      For example, a dopant may be added to adjust conditions at which the
      insulator-metal phase change material undergoes the phase transition.
DETX  Electronic devices protected by the RF shutter may retain normal
      operation (e.g., transmission and reception of relatively low-power,
      low-frequency signals) during periods between exposures to relatively
      high-power or high-frequency signals. However, during exposure to the
      high-power or high-frequency signals, the RF shutter may respond quickly
      and with little complexity to protect the electronic devices. To
      illustrate, when a high-power or high-frequency signal is received at the
      RF shutter, a large electric field may be generated in each microgap. The
      electric field may be sufficient to form an atmospheric pressure plasma
      or to initiate a phase transition in a phase change material, causing the
      mesh to behave as a continuous mesh. Thus, the mesh may act like a ground
      plane and reflect the high-power or high-frequency signal to protect the
      electronics behind it. Accordingly, a passive RF shutter can protect
      electronics from high-power and high-frequency signals when in an "on"
      state and allow transmission and reception of lower power, lower
      frequency signals when in an "off" state. A power level and a frequency
      of an incoming signal may determine whether the RF shutter is on or off.
DETX  FIG. 1A is a plan view of a particular embodiment of an apparatus 100 to
      protect an electronic device, and FIG. 1B is a closer view of a
      particular portion of the apparatus 100. The apparatus 100 includes a
      non-conductive substrate 102 and a plurality of conductive members 106.
      The conductive members 106 are arranged to form a discontinuous mesh 104.
      For example, the conductive members 106 may be arranged in cells, two of
      which are illustrated in FIG. 1B, with a gap 110 between adjacent cells.
      For example as shown in FIG. 1B, two cells including conductive members
      106 and 107 are separated by the gap 110. Each of the cells has a
      characteristic dimension 114, such as width from center to center of
      adjacent gaps or a width from center to center of the conductive members
      106 and 107. In a particular embodiment, the cells are approximately
      square and the characteristic dimension 114 is selected based on a first
      wavelength of a first signal to be allowed to pass through the apparatus
      100 and a second wavelength of a second signal that is to be blocked by
      the apparatus 100. For example, the characteristic dimension 114 may be
      much smaller than the first wavelength, e.g., approximately one
      twenty-fifth of the first wavelength. In another example, the
      characteristic dimension 114 may be smaller than but closer to the second
      wavelength, e.g., approximately one half of the second wavelength.
      However, other proportions between the characteristic dimension 114 and
      the wavelength of the first signal and the second signal may also be
      used.
DETX  A width of the gaps 110 is related to electric field strength present in
      the gap 110 when the conductive elements 106 and 107 are subjected to
      electromagnetic radiation. For a particular frequency of electromagnetic
      radiation, a smaller gap width leads to a stronger electric field in the
      gap 110 and a larger gap width provides a weaker electric field in the
      gap 110.
DETX  The non-conductive substrate 102 may include a ceramic material, a
      polymer material, or another material that is not conductive or is
      dielectric. The non-conductive substrate 102 may be substantially
      transparent to electromagnetic energy in a particular range of concern.
      For example, the non-conductive substrate 102 may be transparent to a
      wavelength of signals intended to be transmitted and received through the
      apparatus 100 (e.g., relatively low-power, relatively low-frequency
      signals). The non-conductive substrate 102 may also be substantially
      transparent to signals to be blocked from transmissions through the
      apparatus 100 (e.g., relatively high-power or relatively high-frequency
      signals). The non-conductive substrate 102 may have a thickness
      sufficient to provide desired structural stability. In a particular
      embodiment, the non-conductive substrate 102 may be formed of a material
      that facilitates removal of heat that may be built up by the apparatus
      100 during use. For example, the non-conductive substrate 102 may be
      formed of aluminum nitride, which is electrically insulating but may have
      suitable thermal conductivity.
DETX  The conductive members 106 and 107 may include any suitable conductor,
      such as silver, gold, copper, aluminum, or another metal or conductor
      selected for a particular application. In a particular embodiment,
      materials used to form the non-conductive substrate 102 and the
      conductive members 106 and 107 may be selected to facilitate low cost
      manufacturing of the apparatus 100. For example, the materials may be
      selected to facilitate manufacturing of the apparatus 100 using
      relatively inexpensive fabrication techniques that are commonly employed
      to manufacture integrated circuits and other electronic devices. To
      illustrate, the materials may be selected to enable manufacturing the
      apparatus 100 using wet etch, dry etch, deposition, photolithography,
      imprint lithography, chemical mechanical polishing, printing, or other
      additive or subtractive processes that are used to manufacture
      electronics and integrated circuits. For purposes of simulations
      described below the conductive members 106 and 107 were simulated to be
      formed of copper. The conductive members 106 and 107 may have a thickness
      of as little as a few skin depths. For example, for copper conductive
      members the skin depth may be approximately 3 microns, so a thickness of
      several skin depths, e.g., about 10 microns, may be sufficient.
DETX  In a particular embodiment, a phase change material 112 may be present at
      each of the gaps 110. For example, as described with reference to FIGS.
      2A and 2B, the phase change material 112 may include a gas that undergoes
      a phase transition to a plasma. In another example, as described with
      reference to FIGS. 3A and 3B, the phase change material 112 may include a
      material that undergoes an insulator-metal phase transition, such as
      vanadium dioxide. The phase change material 112 may undergo a phase
      transition from a substantially non-conductive phase to a substantially
      conductive phase at least partially responsive to an incident
      electromagnetic waveform at the apparatus 100. Thus, the discontinuous
      mesh 104 may act as a continuous mesh responsive to the incident
      electromagnetic waveform. Accordingly, the apparatus 100 may selectively
      inhibit transmission of electromagnetic radiation based, for example, on
      characteristics of the electromagnetic radiation.
DETX  FIG. 2A is a sectional side view of a gap 110 between cells of a first
      embodiment of the apparatus 100 of FIG. 1A in a first operational state.
      FIG. 2B is a sectional side view of the gap 110 between the cells of the
      first embodiment of the apparatus 100 of FIG. 1A in a second operational
      state. As illustrated in FIG. 2A, a first signal having a first waveform
      120 may be received at the apparatus 100 and may be transmitted or
      permitted to propagate through the apparatus 100. Referring to FIG. 2B, a
      second signal having a second waveform 122 may be received at the
      apparatus 100 and may cause a gas (e.g., the phase change material 112 in
      the embodiment of FIG. 2A) in a cavity 116 defined proximate the gap 110
      to form a plasma 130. The plasma 130 provides a conductive path across
      the gap 110. The plasma 130 may be electrically conductive enough to
      bridge the gap 110 to cause the discontinuous mesh formed by the
      conductive members 106 and 107 to behave as a continuous mesh. For
      example, electron density in the gap 110 may range from about 10^13
      electrons per cubic centimeter to as much as 10^17 electrons per cubic
      centimeter, with a conductivity measuring from about 10^2 Siemens per
      meter (S/m) to about 10^4 S/m. Thus, the second signal having the second
      waveform 122 stimulates formation of the plasma 130 and thereby causes
      the discontinuous mesh to be continuous, blocking or inhibiting
      transmission or propagation of the second signal.
DETX  In the embodiment of FIGS. 2A and 2B, the cavity 116 may be formed in the
      non-conductive substrate 102 at the gap 110 between the adjacent
      conductive members 106 and 107. The cavity 116 may undercut a portion of
      the adjacent conductive members 106 and 107. The cavity 116 may have a
      depth of a same order of magnitude as the width of the gap 110. For
      example, when the width of the gap 110 is about 20 .mu.m, the cavity 116
      may have a depth of about 10 .mu.m to about 40 .mu.m. The cavity 116 may
      include the gas that forms the plasma 130 when the gas is excited by
      particular electromagnetic waveforms.
DETX  In a particular embodiment, the gas is retained by an overlaying
      substrate 103. In yet another embodiment, the overlaying substrate 103
      may be large enough to encapsulate the whole mesh array rather than at
      individual gap 110 areas. The overlaying substrate 103 may be formed of
      the same material as the non-conductive substrate 102. For example, the
      conductive members 106 and 107 may be substantially encased or embedded
      within the non-conductive substrate 102 and the overlaying substrate 103.
      In another particular embodiment, the overlaying substrate 103 may not be
      present. For example, an upper surface 108 of the apparatus 100 may be
      exposed to air, and the air may form the plasma 130. In another example,
      the upper surface 108 of the apparatus 100 may be covered to retain the
      gas that forms the plasma 130. The gas may include air, a noble gas
      (e.g., argon), or another gas that has an acceptable operating range
      between an electric field strength that causes the gas to generate the
      plasma 130 and an electric field strength that causes dielectric
      breakdown of the gas, as described further below. For example, the
      dielectric breakdown field strength for air is about 60 times the plasma
      generation field strength, providing a dynamic operating range of about
      18 decibels.
DETX  The apparatus 100 may selectively inhibit transmission of electromagnetic
      radiation based on characteristics of the electromagnetic radiation. For
      example, the gas may form the plasma 130 that electrically bridges the
      gap 110 to form an electrically continuous mesh in response to
      electromagnetic radiation having first characteristics (e.g., the second
      waveform 122). When the plasma 130 electrically bridges the gaps, the
      electromagnetic radiation having the first characteristics is inhibited
      from passing through the apparatus 100. However, the apparatus 100 allows
      electromagnetic radiation that has second characteristics (e.g., the
      first waveform 120) to pass through the apparatus 100.
DETX  FIG. 3A is a sectional side view of a gap 110 between cells of a second
      embodiment of the apparatus 100 of FIG. 1A in a first operational state.
      FIG. 3B is a sectional side view of the gap 110 between the cells of the
      second embodiment of the apparatus 100 of FIG. 1A in a second operational
      state. As illustrated in FIG. 3A, in the first operational state, the
      phase change material 112 is in a substantially non-conductive phase, and
      a first signal having a first waveform 120 may be received at the
      apparatus 100 and may be transmitted or permitted to propagate through
      the apparatus 100. Referring to FIG. 3B, a second signal having a second
      waveform 122 may be received at the apparatus 100 and may cause the
      apparatus 100 to transition to the second operation state. For example,
      the second waveform 122 may cause the phase change material 112 to
      undergo a phase transition to a substantially conductive state. In the
      substantially conductive state, the phase change material 112 provides a
      conductive path across the gap 110. Thus, in the substantially conductive
      state, the phase change material 112 causes the discontinuous mesh to
      become continuous, blocking or inhibiting transmission or propagation of
      the second signal.
DETX  In the embodiment of FIGS. 3A and 3B, the phase change material 112 may
      include any material that undergoes a solid-solid metal-insulator phase
      transition. Such solid-solid metal-insulator phase transitions are also
      referred to in the art as semiconductor-metal phase transitions. Examples
      of such materials that undergo a solid-solid metal-insulator phase
      transition include, but are not limited to, GeSb.sub.2Te.sub.4,
      RNiO.sub.3 (where R=Pr, Nd, or Sm), LaCoO.sub.3, particular transition
      metal oxides, such as certain titanium oxides, e.g., titanium sequioxide
      (Ti.sub.2O.sub.3), certain vanadium oxides, e.g., vanadium dioxide
      (VO.sub.2), and vanadium sequioxide (V.sub.2O.sub.3). The phase change
      material 112 may also be doped with another material to modify
      characteristics of the phase transition, such as a phase transition
      critical temperature or another critical property at which the phase
      transition occurs (e.g., electric field strength, current, voltage,
      etc.). Dopants may include, for example, W, Cr, Ta, Al or another
      material.
DETX  The apparatus 100 may selectively inhibit transmission of electromagnetic
      radiation based on characteristics of the electromagnetic radiation. For
      example, the phase change material 112 may undergo the phase transition
      responsive, at least partially, to the characteristics of the
      electromagnetic radiation. That is, the characteristics of the
      electromagnetic radiation alone or in concert with other factors (e.g., a
      temperature of the apparatus 100, a bias current applied to the apparatus
      100, another signal applied to the apparatus 100, or another factor that
      preconditions or biases the phase change material 112 to be near a phase
      transition critical point) may cause the phase change material 112 to
      undergo the phase transition. To illustrate, the first waveform 120 may
      have first characteristics (e.g., frequency, power, electric field
      generated in the gap 110) that do not cause the phase change material 112
      to undergo the phase transition, and the second waveform 122 may have
      second characteristics (e.g., frequency, power, electric field generated
      in the gap 110) that cause the phase change material 112 to undergo the
      phase transition.
DETX  FIG. 4A is a perspective view of a first particular embodiment of a
      system to protect an electronic device in a first operational state. The
      system includes an electronic device 404 coupled to an antenna 402 and
      protected by the apparatus 100. The electronic device 404 may include one
      or more low-noise amplifiers or other devices to be protected from
      high-power or high-frequency signals.
DETX  A first signal having a first waveform 420 may be transmitted by a
      transmitter 406 and received at the antenna 402. The first waveform 420
      may have characteristics (such as a wavelength 408) that do not cause a
      phase change material present in gaps of the apparatus 100 to undergo a
      phase transition. Thus, the first signal is able to pass through the
      apparatus 100, to be received at the antenna 402, and to be sent as a
      signal 410 to the electronic device 404.
DETX  FIG. 4B is a perspective view of the system of FIG. 4A in a second
      operational state. In FIG. 4B, the transmitter 406 transmits a second
      signal having a second waveform 432. The second waveform 432 may be
      characterized by particular parameters, such as a second wavelength 430,
      an amplitude, a signal strength, and so forth. When the second signal is
      received at the apparatus 100, the second signal may stimulate the phase
      change material of the apparatus 100 to undergo the phase transition.
      Accordingly, the apparatus 100 in FIG. 4B is illustrated as continuous
      (i.e., without gaps) due to the presence of the substantially conductive
      phase of the phase change material in the gaps of the apparatus 100. The
      apparatus 100 may act as a ground plane to reflect or block transmission
      of the second signal, resulting in the second signal not being received
      at the antenna 402. As illustrated in FIG. 4B, no second signal 434 is
      received at the electronic device 404, and the electronic device 404 is
      protected from harm as a result of the second signal.
DETX  Thus, the apparatus 100 acts as a passive RF shutter to that allows some
      signals to pass through and blocks or reflects other signals. Put another
      way, the apparatus 100 has a first operational state in which the
      apparatus 100 is substantially transparent to a first electromagnetic
      waveform and a second operational state that is engaged when the
      apparatus 100 is exposed to a second electromagnetic waveform that is
      different than the first electromagnetic waveform. In the second
      operational state, the apparatus 100 may be substantially opaque to the
      first electromagnetic waveform and to the second electromagnetic
      waveform. The apparatus 100 is able to block certain signals quickly,
      with little added complexity, and without the use of external control
      systems and power systems. Rather, the signal to be blocked itself
      stimulates the phase transition that causes the signal to be blocked.
      Accordingly, the switching time required to switch the apparatus 100 from
      the first operational state (where signals are allowed to pass through)
      to the second operational state (where signals are not allowed to pass
      through) may be less than about 2 nanoseconds. In some embodiments, the
      switching time may be less than a nanosecond. For example, the switching
      time when a solid-solid phase change material is used may be less than
      one picoseconds, e.g., about 100 femtoseconds.
DETX  FIG. 5 is a perspective view of a second particular embodiment of a
      system to protect the electronic device 404. The system of FIG. 5 is an
      active protection system for the electronic device 404. The system
      includes a third transmitter 526 that sends a third signal having a third
      waveform 522. The third waveform 522 may include particular
      characteristics, such as a third wavelength 524, an amplitude, and signal
      strength when received at the apparatus 100. As previously described, the
      apparatus 100 is discontinuous and substantially transparent to signals
      having certain waveforms, which enables those signals to be received at
      the antenna 402. In a particular embodiment, the third waveform 522 is
      selected to stimulate the phase transition in the phase change material
      present in the gaps of the apparatus 100. For example, the third
      transmitter 526 may be a relatively low power, high frequency transmitter
      located relatively near the antenna 402.
DETX  In a particular embodiment, the third transmitter 526 is under control of
      a controller 540 associated with the electronic device 404. The third
      transmitter 526 may be used to turn on protective characteristics of the
      apparatus 100 in response to the controller 540. For example, the
      transmitter 406 may be a perceived threat to the electronic device 404.
      That is, the transmitter 406 may be capable of transmitting a fourth
      signal 520 that may be harmful to the electronic device 404. The
      controller 540 may engage the third transmitter 526 to stimulate the
      phase transition of the phase change material of the apparatus 100 when
      the perceived threat is near the electronic device 404.
DETX  In another example, the transmitter 406 may be a relatively high-power
      transmitter that is collocated with the electronic device 404. The
      transmitter 406 may periodically or occasionally transmit signals that
      could be harmful to the electronic device 404. The controller 540 may
      selectively engage the third transmitter 526 to stimulate the phase
      transition of the phase change material of the apparatus 100 when the
      transmitter 406 is transmitting or is about to transmit the potentially
      harmful fourth signal 520.
DETX  In yet another example, the third transmitter 526 may send the third
      signal to stimulate the phase transition of the phase change material all
      of the time except for when the electronic device 404 is to send or
      receive signals via the antenna 402. To illustrate, the third transmitter
      526 may leave the apparatus 100 "on" (e.g., in the second operational
      state described above) to block signals from being received at the
      electronic device 404 until a particular time when the signals are
      expected or desired, at which point the third transmitter 526 may cease
      sending the third signal to turn the apparatus 100 "off" (e.g., in the
      first operational state described above).
DETX  In a particular embodiment, the system includes the first apparatus 100
      and a second apparatus 550. The second apparatus 550 may be included as a
      layer over or under the first apparatus 100. The second apparatus 550 may
      include a second discontinuous mesh formed by second conductive members
      spaced apart by second gaps. The second apparatus 550 may be configured
      to transition from the first operational state, in which the mesh of the
      second apparatus 550 is discontinuous, to the second operation state, in
      which the mesh of the second apparatus 550 behaves as continuous, in a
      different manner than or responsive to different conditions than the
      first apparatus 100. For example, the second gaps may have different
      widths than the gaps of the apparatus 100. The width of the gap may be
      related to the electric field strength in the gap when a mesh is exposed
      to electromagnetic radiation. Thus, smaller gaps may exhibit a stronger
      electric field than larger gaps. Accordingly, the larger gaps of the
      second apparatus 550 may experience smaller electric fields than the
      smaller gaps of the first apparatus 100 when both are subjected to the
      fourth signal 520. Thus, a phase change that is responsive to electric
      field strength may occur under different circumstance in the second
      apparatus 550 than at the first apparatus 100. To illustrate, a higher
      power signal or higher frequency signal may cause the phase transition of
      the second apparatus 550 than a signal that causes the phase transition
      of the first apparatus 100. A very high power signal may cause failure of
      the first apparatus 100, e.g., by exceeding a dielectric breakdown
      threshold of the phase change material. In this circumstance, the second
      apparatus 550 provides a higher power tolerance backup to the first
      apparatus 100, while the first apparatus 100 provides lower power
      switching to the second operational state (e.g., "on" state) to provide a
      fast switching response to the fourth signal 520.
DETX  To illustrate, when the phase change material is a gas that undergoes a
      phase transition to a plasma and when the fourth signal 620 is a
      relatively high-power signal, the smaller gaps of the apparatus 100 may
      have a strong enough electric field to exceed a dielectric breakdown
      threshold of the gas in the gaps of the apparatus 100. Thus, the gaps of
      the apparatus 100 may experience damaging arching or coronal discharge.
      The second gaps of the second apparatus 550 are larger and have a smaller
      electric field. When the apparatus 100 and the second apparatus 550 use
      the same gas in their respective gaps, the second gaps can endure a
      stronger signal than the gaps of the apparatus 100 without exceeding the
      dielectric breakdown threshold of the gas. In a particular embodiment,
      the apparatus 100 and the second apparatus 550 may use different gases
      with different dielectric breakdown threshold to provide protection
      against signals with different signal strengths.
DETX  In another example, the first apparatus 100 may include a first
      metal-insulator phase change material and the second apparatus 550 may
      include a second metal-insulator phase change material. The first
      metal-insulator phase change material may undergo a phase transition
      under different circumstances than the second metal-insulator phase
      change material. Thus, the first metal-insulator phase change material
      and the second metal-insulator phase change material may be responsive to
      different signal characteristics and thus provide protection against
      different signals. Alternately, or in addition, the first metal-insulator
      phase change material may fail (e.g., due to resistive heating) under
      different circumstances than the second metal-insulator phase change
      material. Thus, the second apparatus 550 may be a backup to the first
      apparatus 100.
DETX  In yet another example, the phase change materials used in each of the
      apparatuses 100, 550 are of different types. To illustrate, the first
      apparatus 100 may include a metal-insulator phase change material, and
      the second apparatus 550 may include a gas that undergoes a phase
      transition to a plasma. Alternately, the second apparatus 550 may include
      the metal-insulator phase change material, and the first apparatus 100
      may include the gas that undergoes the phase transition to the plasma.
      The particular types of the phase change materials of each apparatus 100,
      550 and the arrangement of the apparatuses 100, 550 may be selected based
      on protective characteristics that are desired for the system. For
      example, since the solid-solid metal-insulator phase transition is
      generally faster than a gas-plasma phase transition, the first apparatus
      100 may use a solid-solid metal-insulator phase change material to
      provide a rapid response solid-solid metal-insulator phase change
      material that may break down at a lower power level than a plasma
      generated in relatively large gaps of the second apparatus 550.
      Accordingly, a gas-plasma material may be used with the relatively large
      gaps in the second apparatus 550.
DETX  Gaps widths, characteristic dimensions, phase change materials (e.g.,
      gases, dopants, etc.), or any combination thereof of the apparatus 100
      and the second apparatus 550 may be selected to cause the apparatus 100
      and the second apparatus 550 to provide different protection
      characteristics. For example, the second apparatus 550 may have a
      different characteristic dimension than the characteristic dimension 114
      (shown in FIG. 1) of the first apparatus 100. Thus, the first apparatus
      100 and the second apparatus 550 may turn on (e.g., transition to the
      second operational state) in response to different waveforms and may be
      able to endure different waveforms without being overpowered (e.g.,
      before a dielectric breakdown threshold is reached). In another example,
      when both of the apparatuses 100, 550 use metal-insulator phase change
      materials in the gaps, the gaps of the apparatuses 100, 550 may be the
      same size and the metal-insulator phase change materials may be different
      to provide different response characteristics of the apparatuses 100,
      550. To illustrate, the first metal-insulator phase change material may
      be doped, and the second metal-insulator phase change material may be
      undoped or differently doped to provide response characteristics that are
      distinct from response characteristics of the first metal-insulator phase
      change material.
DETX  Further, although only two apparatuses are illustrated in FIG. 5, the
      system may include more than two apparatuses or layers. When more than
      two apparatuses are included, the additional apparatus or apparatuses may
      have characteristic dimensions, phase change materials (e.g., gases,
      dopants, etc.) and/or gaps selected to provide desired protection
      characteristics. Additionally, although the second apparatus 550 is only
      shown in the active system illustrated in FIG. 5, the second apparatus
      550 or other layers may be used with a passive system, such as the system
      described with reference to FIGS. 4A and 4B.
DETX  FIG. 6 illustrates a first particular embodiment of a method of
      protecting an electronic device. The method includes, at 602, permitting
      a first signal having a first electromagnetic waveform to pass through an
      apparatus. For example, the apparatus may be a protection device, such as
      the apparatus 100 of FIG. 1, that includes a non-conductive substrate and
      a discontinuous mesh of conductive members. A phase change material may
      be disposed between the conductive members of the discontinuous mesh. The
      phase change material may undergo a phase transition from substantially
      non-conductive to substantially conductive at least partially responsive
      to the second electromagnetic waveform. For example, the phase transition
      may include a solid-solid metal-insulator phase transition, a gas-plasma
      phase transition, or another phase transition that results in a
      non-conductive to substantially conductive material becoming conductive.
DETX  The method also includes, at 604, blocking a second signal having a
      second electromagnetic waveform at the apparatus. The second
      electromagnetic waveform may be different than the first electromagnetic
      waveform. The second electromagnetic waveform may cause the phase change
      material to undergo the phase transition and to become substantially
      conductive. For example, a wavelength of the second electromagnetic
      waveform may be smaller than a wavelength of the first electromagnetic
      waveform, at 606. The phase change material may undergo the phase
      transition responsive, at least in part, to effects of the wavelength of
      the second electromagnetic waveform on the apparatus or on the phase
      change material. In another example, a power of the second signal may be
      greater than the first signal, at 608. The phase change material may
      undergo the phase transition responsive, at least in part, to effects of
      the power of the second electromagnetic waveform.
DETX  The method may also include, at 610, applying an activation signal to the
      apparatus to cause the second signal to be blocked. For example, a
      transmitter, such as the third transmitter 526 of FIG. 5, may be used to
      selectively turn the apparatus "on," so that signals are blocked, or
      "off," so that signals can pass through. In a particular embodiment, the
      activation signal may have a first polarization and an incoming signal
      may have a second polarization that is different from the first
      polarization. The incoming signal may be blocked based on first
      polarization of the activation signal, at 612.
DETX  FIG. 7 illustrates a second particular embodiment of a method of
      protecting an electronic device. The method includes, at 702, permitting
      a first signal having a first electromagnetic waveform to pass through an
      apparatus. For example, the apparatus may be a protection device, such as
      the apparatus 100, that includes a discontinuous mesh of conductive
      members separated by gaps. The apparatus may include a non-conductive
      substrate and a plurality of cells including conductive members.
      Conductive members may be arranged to form the discontinuous mesh. Each
      conductive member of a cell is separated from conductive members of
      adjacent cells by a gap. A cavity may be defined in the non-conductive
      substrate at each gap. In response to exposure to particular
      electromagnetic waveforms, a plasma may be formed in the cavity at each
      gap.
DETX  The method also includes, at 704, blocking a second signal having a
      second electromagnetic waveform at the apparatus. The second
      electromagnetic waveform may be different than the first electromagnetic
      waveform. For example, the second electromagnetic waveform may cause a
      material present in the cavity at each gap to be ionized to form a
      plasma, at 706. To illustrate, a wavelength of the second electromagnetic
      waveform may be smaller than a wavelength of the first electromagnetic
      waveform, at 708. The wavelength of the second electromagnetic waveform
      may stimulate or excite the material present in the cavity to form the
      plasma. In another illustrative example, the power of the second signal
      may be greater than the first signal, at 710. The plasma may be
      stimulated in the cavity at each gap in response to the second signal due
      to the signal strength.
DETX  The method may also include, at 712, applying an activation signal to the
      apparatus to cause the second signal to be blocked. For example, a
      transmitter, such as the third transmitter 526 of FIG. 5, may be used to
      selectively turn the apparatus "on," so that signals are blocked, or
      "off," so that signals can pass through. In a particular embodiment, the
      activation signal may have a first polarization and an incoming signal
      may have a second polarization that is different from the first
      polarization. The incoming signal may be blocked based on first
      polarization of the activation signal, at 714.
DETX  FIGS. 8-13 illustrate results of simulations that were conducted to
      characterize performance of a protection device, such as the apparatus
      100 described above. For purposes of the simulations, the conductive
      members 106 and 107 of the apparatus 100 were simulated as 70 .mu.m wide
      copper traces with gaps midway between intersections of vertical and
      horizontal traces. For a first simulation, results of which are
      illustrated in FIGS. 8, 9, 10 and 12, the gaps 110 were simulated as
      having a width of approximately 20 .mu.m, and the cell size or
      characteristic dimension 114 of the cells was simulated as about 5 mm.
      For a second simulation, results of which are illustrated in FIG. 11, the
      gaps 110 were simulated as having a width of approximately 80 .mu.m, and
      the cell size or characteristic dimension 114 of the cells was simulated
      as about 5 mm.
DETX  FIG. 8 is a graph of scattering parameters of a simulated protection
      device in a first operational state in which the gaps are discontinuities
      in the conductive members. As shown in FIG. 8, when subjected to a 2.45
      gigahertz signal, substantially all of the signal is transmitted through
      the apparatus, with less than a 30 decibel reflection at 2.45 gigahertz.
DETX  FIG. 9 is a graph of simulated scattering parameters of a particular
      embodiment of a protection device in a second operational state in which
      no discontinuities are present in the conductive members. FIG. 9 shows
      that with the gaps bridged, the apparatus 100 acts as an effective ground
      plane and reflects most of the incoming signal with less than 12 decimals
      getting through at 2.45 gigahertz. It is noted that performance of the
      apparatus 100 may be improved by adjusting a size of the mesh (e.g., a
      distance between intersection points or approximate size of the cells) to
      be more sub-wavelength. The performance of the apparatus 100 may also be
      improved by using several layers of mesh with different characteristics.
DETX  FIG. 10 is a graph of simulated electric field characteristics across
      half of a gap of a discontinuous mesh according to a first particular
      embodiment. Magnitude of the electric field is shown along the y-axis. A
      location along the gap is shown along the x-axis, starting at distance 0,
      which is the edge of a conductive member, and extending to a distance 10
      .mu.m from the edge of the conductive member, which is approximately a
      center of the gap. The electric field across the gap is believed to be
      approximately symmetric about the center of the gap; thus, only half of
      the gap was simulated. The graph in FIG. 10 shows the electric field
      strength at points in the gap when the conductive members are exposed to
      a 2.45 GHz signal at various incident power levels. For example, at an
      incident power of about 1 watt/cm^2, the electric field strength inside
      the gap ranges from about 3.5.times.10^5 volts per meter to about
      6.times.10^5 volts per meter, as shown by line 1004. At an incident power
      of 0.1 watt/cm^2, the electric field strength ranges from about
      1.times.10^5 volts per meter to about 1.9.times.10^5 volts per meter, as
      shown by line 1008. Both of these incident power levels produce
      sufficient electric field strength to initiate plasma in the gap. That
      is, both incident power levels exceed a plasma threshold of air 1010. Yet
      both of these incident power levels remain safely below the dielectric
      breakdown threshold of air 1002.
DETX  Studies by others have shown that vanadium (IV) oxide (VO.sub.2) can be
      stimulated to transition from an insulator phase to a metal phase by 7.1
      volts over a 3 micron gap, or a field strength of 2.4.times.10^6 volts
      per meter, which is less than the field strength for a gap of a few
      microns at incident power of 1 W/cm^2. Accordingly, it is believed that
      threshold power for vanadium oxide can be lowered significantly below 1
      W/cm^2 with a smaller gap, even sub-micron sizes.
DETX  Different gap sizes may accommodate different incident power levels
      without exceeding the dielectric breakdown threshold of air 1002.
      Additionally, different gases may have different plasma thresholds and
      dielectric breakdown thresholds. Accordingly, a gap size and a gas may be
      selected to provide protection for particular incident power levels of
      particular frequencies of electromagnetic radiation.
DETX  FIG. 11 is a graph of simulated electric field characteristics across
      half of a gap of a discontinuous mesh according to a second particular
      embodiment. As in FIG. 10, only a half-gap is illustrated. The gap
      simulated for FIG. 11 has a width of gap at 80 .mu.m. Since the electric
      field strength is believed to be symmetrical in the gap, the x-axis shows
      the distance from the edge of a conductive member at 0 to the midpoint of
      the gap at 40 .mu.m. The graph in FIG. 11 also shows the dielectric
      breakdown threshold of air 1002 and the plasma threshold of air 1010. The
      graph shows electric field strength for a 2.45 GHz signal at various
      incident power levels.
DETX  The electric field strength in the gap for a 1 watt/cm^2 incident power
      is shown by line 1108. Thus, for the 80 .mu.m gap, 1 watt/cm^2 incident
      power is sufficient to surpass the plasma threshold of air 1010 but
      remains below the dielectric breakdown threshold of air 1002. The
      electric field strength in the gap for a 5 watt/cm^2 incident power is
      shown by line 1106, and the electric field strength in the gap for a 10
      watt/cm^2 incident power is shown by line 1104. Both the 5 watt/cm^2
      incident power and the 10 watt/cm^2 incident power are sufficient to
      surpass the plasma threshold of air 1010 but remain below the dielectric
      breakdown threshold of air 1002. Thus, by widening the gap from the 20
      .mu.m gap simulated in FIG. 10 to the 80 .mu.m gap simulated in FIG. 11,
      a higher incident power level signal can be blocked. For example, the 80
      .mu.m gap can withstand at least a 10 watt/cm^2 incident power level
      without reaching the dielectric breakdown threshold of air 1002.
DETX  FIG. 12 is a graph of simulated electric field characteristics across
      half of a gap of a discontinuous mesh according to a third particular
      embodiment. For FIG. 12, the gap was simulated as having a width of 20
      .mu.m, with half of the gap shown in FIG. 12. FIG. 12 shows how a higher
      frequency signal with a lower incident power level affects the electric
      field in the gap. Specifically, FIG. 12 shows the electric field in the
      gap for various incident power levels of a 30.6 GHz signal, as compared
      to the 2.45 GHz signal used for FIG. 10 with the same gap width. The
      plasma threshold of air 1010 and the dielectric breakdown threshold of
      air 1002 are also shown in FIG. 12.
DETX  The higher frequency signal used for FIG. 12 may provide better coupling
      across the gap using less power. To illustrate, line 1206 shows the
      electric field across the gap at a 1 mW/cm^2 incident power level. Thus,
      using a 30.6 GHz signal, an incident power level as low as 1 mW/cm^2 is
      sufficient to generate a plasma in the gap. The line 1204 shows the
      electric field across the gap at a 10 mW/cm^2 incident power level.
DETX  While the simulations described above illustrate effects of frequency of
      a received signal and gap width and power on generation of a plasma,
      another consideration is response time. That is, how long it takes for
      the mesh to switch from an inactive state to an active state. The
      switching response time may be approximated by a time required for the
      phase change. For example, when the phase change material used is a gas
      that transitions to a plasma, the switching response time is
      approximately the plasma initiation time, e.g., how much time is required
      to initiate the plasma. The plasma is initiated when electrons of the gas
      in the gap become ionized. Thus, a time required for an electron to
      achieve ionization energy in response to an electric field is an estimate
      of the plasma initiation time.
DETX  FIG. 13 is a graph of estimated turn on time of a protection device
      according to a particular embodiment. FIG. 13 graphs an approximation of
      the time required for an electron in an electric field to gain enough
      energy for ionization neglecting electron energy lost during inelastic
      collisions with gas molecular species. This graph demonstrates that for
      various electric field strengths, the time required for an electron to
      become ionized is less than about two nanoseconds. Accordingly, the turn
      on response time for this particular embodiment is expected to be about
      two nanoseconds or less. The solid-solid metal insulator phase transition
      in vanadium dioxide has been estimated in some tests to take
      approximately 100 femtoseconds. Accordingly, embodiments that use a
      solid-solid metal insulator phase change material may have a response
      time that is less than one picoseconds, e.g., about 100 femtoseconds.
DETX  Various embodiments disclosed provide protection devices to protect
      electronics. A protection device includes a discontinuous mesh that can
      act as a protective screen for communication systems and other electronic
      systems that may be susceptible to electromagnetic damage due to
      high-power electromagnetic radiation. The discontinuous mesh may act as a
      nonlinear element that is substantially transparent to electromagnetic
      radiation at low powers or particular frequencies and that becomes
      substantially opaque or reflective to high-power electromagnetic
      radiation. The protection device may be passive in that it reacts to
      switch from the transparent state to the opaque state in response to the
      incident electromagnetic radiation that is to be blocked. The protection
      device may also be actively controlled by transmitting a signal having a
      desired modulation toward the discontinuous mesh when it is desired to
      switch the discontinuous mesh to a protection state. The protection
      device may include multiple layers of the discontinuous mesh to provide
      protection at different incident power levels.
DETX  The discontinuous mesh may act as an electromagnetic shutter to provide
      passive protection without requiring sensing systems or other complex
      circuitry for switching. Characteristics of an incident signal (e.g., the
      incident power level and frequency) may determine whether the incident
      signal is allowed to pass through the discontinuous mesh or is blocked by
      the discontinuous mesh.
DETX  Using active modulation, it is possible to illuminate the discontinuous
      mesh using a relatively high frequency, low power illumination signal in
      order to activate the protection device. The frequency of the
      illumination signal may be approximately a resonant frequency of the
      discontinuous mesh based on cell size (e.g., spacing of conductive
      members of the discontinuous mesh). Thus, the illumination signal may
      have a wavelength on an order of about two times the cell size. Since the
      discontinuous mesh may be designed for a working signal (e.g., a signal
      that is allowed to pass through) with a wavelength on an order of about
      twenty-five times the cell size there may be little interference between
      the working signal and the illumination signal. Frequency of the
      illumination signal can also be chosen to be between harmonics of
      operating frequencies of an aperture associated with the protection
      device to avoid unwanted coupling of the aperture. When active modulation
      of the discontinuous mesh is used, polarization of the illumination
      signal may cause the screen to selectively block signals having a
      particular polarity. For example, depending on polarization of the
      illumination signal, either vertically or horizontally polarized incoming
      signals may be blocked.
DETX  A unit cell size of the discontinuous mesh may be selected to improve
      performance for particular incident signals. For example, the unit cell
      size may be selected to be much smaller than a wavelength of the
      particular incident signal to increase a reflection coefficient of the
      discontinuous mesh. A gap width of the discontinuous mesh can be selected
      to mitigate a specific threshold level of incident power. For example,
      larger gaps may be used to mitigate higher incident power levels.
      Additionally, multiple discontinuous mesh layers with varying gap widths
      can be used to mitigate a broader range of incident power levels. For
      example, two mesh layers may be used with a first layer having wider gaps
      than a second layer. The first layer may only turn on for relatively high
      incident power levels. The second layer may be activated for lower
      incident power levels, but may be overpowered by the higher incident
      power levels. Additionally, when the first layer is on top of the second
      layer, the second layer may be activated by "spill over" from the first
      layer, providing additional protection. That is, when a relatively
      high-power signal activates the first layer, a portion of the high-power
      signal may pass through the first layer. The portion of the high-power
      signal that passes through the first layer may be sufficient to activate
      the second layer, enabling the second layer to provide additional
      protection. Each layer may provide up to about 25 decibels of attenuation
      and up to about 18 decibels of dynamic operating range of the incident
      power level.

      No. 10-2011-0055402, filed on Jun. 9, 2011 in the Korean Intellectual
      Property Office, the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by
      reference.
BSTX BACKGROUND
BSTX  1. Field
BSTX  The following description relates to a cylindrical electromagnetic
      bandgap capable of improving electromagnetic interference (EMI) and a
      coaxial cable having the same.
BSTX  2. Description of the Related Art
BSTX  In general, EMI (electromagnetic interference) has been considered a
      chronic problem in operating an electronic device with a high frequency.
BSTX  RFI (Radio Frequency Interference) is an electromagnetic interference
      that occurs inside a product, and such phenomenon particularly reduces
      the function of wireless reception. The operating frequencies of recent
      electronic products range from several hundred MHz to several GHz.
      Accordingly, as various wireless functions such as wireless Internet,
      GPS, WiFi, or Bluetooth, for example, have been adopted, the effect of an
      EMI or a RFI has received significant attention.
BSTX  Also, for electronic products that use RF cables, such as notebook PCs,
      tablet PCs, or handheld phones, for example, the noise of electromagnetic
      waves developed inside the system interferes with the cable, resulting in
      induced common-mode currents that affect a signal received through an
      antenna, and degrade the reception sensitivity.
BSTX SUMMARY
BSTX  Therefore, it is an aspect of the present disclosure to provide a
      cylindrical electromagnetic bandgap capable of improving an EMI.

DETX DETAILED DESCRIPTION
DETX  Reference will now be made in detail to the embodiments of the present
      disclosure, examples of which are illustrated in the accompanying
      drawings, wherein like reference numerals refer to like elements
      throughout.
DETX  As illustrated in FIGS. 1 and 2, a coaxial cable 10 transmits electrical
      signals from an electronic device 1 (a notebook PC, for example) to an
      antenna (A). The electronic device is equipped with a main board embodied
      with a RF circuit, or a digital circuit, for example. The coaxial cable
      has one end connected to a connector (not shown) attached to a wireless
      apparatus 2 of a board 3, and the other end connected to the antenna (A).
DETX  The coaxial cable 10 is a type of transmission line used for data
      transmission that can transmit electric signals, because the coaxial
      cable 10 is formed with an outer conductor 10b and an inner conductor 10a
      in a concentric circle. The coaxial cable 10 has the ability to transmit
      low frequency electrical signals and high frequency electrical signals,
      in addition to direct current.
DETX  A dielectric D1 is provided between the outer conductor 10b and the inner
      conductor 10a of the coaxial cable 10.
DETX  However, in the case where the coaxial cable 10 is positioned inside the
      electronic apparatus 1 where such various circuits and system are
      provided, noise in the form of electromagnetic waves developed from a PCB
      located inside the electronic apparatus 1 is conveyed through the surface
      of the coaxial cable 10 after being induced as noise currents on the
      coaxial cable 10.
DETX  Because the outer conductor 10b is not provided on a connecting portion
      between the inner conductor 10a of the coaxial cable 10 and the antenna
      (A), noise in the form of an electromagnetic wave interference is
      developed inside the inner conductor 10a that affects signals received
      from the antenna (A), disturbing signal reception.
DETX  According to an embodiment of the present disclosure, in order to prevent
      signal reduction or decreased reception as a result of induced noise
      currents on a surface of the coaxial cable 10 affecting the inner
      conductor 10a or the antenna (A), a cylindrical electromagnetic bandgap
      20 is installed on the coaxial cable 10.
DETX  Referring to FIG. 3 and FIG. 4, the cylindrical electromagnetic bandgap
      20 of the present disclosure is provided to cover the outside of the
      coaxial cable 10.
DETX  The cylindrical electromagnetic bandgap 20 includes a conductor patch (or
      shield) 21 and a via (or connecting link) 22.
DETX  Each of the conductor patch 21 and the via 22 is provided in a
      cylindrical shape to cover the coaxial cable 10, and each of the
      conductor patch 21 and the via 22 is provided in a plurality to form a
      nearly complete cylindrical shape.
DETX  The conductor patch 21 has a curved surface to be spaced apart by a
      predetermined gap distance from the outer conductor 10b of the coaxial
      cable 10.
DETX  The conductor patch 21 is coaxially formed in relation to the outer
      conductor 10b and the inner conductor 10a of the coaxial cable 10.
DETX  The via 22 connects the outer conductor 10b of the coaxial cable 10 to
      the conductor patch 21.
DETX  The via 22 extends perpendicularly from an inner surface of the conductor
      patch having a curved surface, and makes contact with the outer conductor
      10b of the coaxial cable 10 to connect the conductor patch 21 and the
      outer conductor 10b of the coaxial cable 10 both structurally and
      electrically. The via 22 may be composed of the same material as the
      conductor patch 21.
DETX  A dielectric D2 may be provided between the outer conductor 10b and the
      conductor patch 21, that is, between the cylindrical electromagnetic
      bandgap 20 and the coaxial cable 10.
DETX  In addition, ferrite material (F) may be provided between the coaxial
      cable 10 and the cylindrical electromagnetic bandgap 20. That is, the
      dielectric D1 is formed between the inner conductor 10a and the outer
      conductor 10b of the coaxial cable 10 while forming ferrite material (F)
      between the conductor patch 21 and the outer conductor 10b. The
      dielectric D2 between the outer conductor 10b and the conductor patch 21
      may include the same dielectric material as the dielectric D1 or include
      a predetermined dielectric material that has the same or different
      dielectric constant as the dielectric D1.
DETX  The ferrite material (F) is used as highly permeable magnetic material
      between a low frequency and several hundred MHz frequency range, and is
      effective in shielding electromagnetic wave noise of a low frequency (see
      FIG. 5).
DETX  Therefore, the use of dielectrics D1 and D2 and/or ferrite material F
      result in a decrease of electromagnetic waves both in a low frequency
      range and a high frequency range.
DETX  In addition, according to this embodiment of the present disclosure, the
      cylindrical electromagnetic bandgap 20 is formed using four conductor
      patches 21 and four vias 22. However, the number of vias 22 or the
      conductor patches 21 is not limited to these numbers.
DETX  In particular, the frequency characteristic of the cylindrical
      electromagnetic bandgap 20 may be changed by changing an area (W*L), a
      thickness, or a gap distance (g) of the conductor patch 21, and
      therefore, tuning a frequency is possible.
DETX  The area (W*L) of the conductor patch 21 is a size of an area that is
      represented by multiplying a width (W) by a length (L) of the conductor
      patch 21, while the gap distance (g) represents a gap between adjacent
      conductor patches 21.
DETX  In addition, although not shown, the frequency characteristic of the
      cylindrical electromagnetic bandgap 20 may be changed by changing an
      area, a thickness, or a gap distance of the via 22.
DETX  Here, the thickness of the via 22 represents a cross-sectional area of
      the via 22, and the gap distance of the via 22 represents a gap between
      adjacent vias 22.
DETX  Therefore, the cylindrical electromagnetic bandgap 20 according to the
      embodiment of the present disclosure is installed on the coaxial cable 10
      that connects the internal wireless apparatus 2 to the antenna (A) inside
      the electronic device 1, as illustrated in FIG. 6.
DETX  The cylindrical electromagnetic bandgap 20 may be formed in plurality of
      rows (1, 2, 3 . . . n) of cylindrical electromagnetic bandgaps 20 in a
      longitudinal direction of the coaxial cable 10.
DETX  The conductor patches 21 of the cylindrical electromagnetic bandgap 20
      are spaced apart in a longitudinal direction of the coaxial cable 10 by a
      predetermined gap from one another. By changing such gap, the frequency
      characteristic of the cylindrical electromagnetic bandgap 20 may be
      changed.
DETX  In this configuration, the cylindrical electromagnetic bandgap 20
      installed around the coaxial cable 10 can shield electromagnetic wave
      noise conveyed on the surface of the coaxial cable 10. The cylindrical
      electromagnetic bandgap 20, when transmitting signals from the coaxial
      cable 10, can improve signal reduction and reception sensitivity, and
      therefore, a reception of a wireless function on an electronic apparatus
      can be improved.
DETX  With reference to the case illustrated by FIGS. 7A and 7B where a
      conventional coaxial cable 10 is placed on a conductor panel (P), and the
      case illustrated by FIGS. 8A and 8B where the coaxial cable 10 having the
      cylindrical electromagnetic bandgap 20 is placed on a conductor panel P,
      ports are established at both ends of the cables to perform a simulation.
      The simulation is performed to obtain characteristics of electromagnetic
      wave noise being conveyed between two ports.
DETX  The coaxial cable 10 is provided at a height of 7 mm (I) above a ground
      surface (100*102.1 mm) while having a length of 102.1 mm. The inner
      conductor has a radius of 0.5 mm, and the outer conductor has a radius of
      0.2 mm with a thickness of 0.2 mm.
DETX  The cylindrical electromagnetic bandgap 20 is provided to have 4
      conductor patches per segment, forming a cylinder with a radius of 4.6 mm
      and a length of 5.0 mm. In this case, a total number of conductor patches
      is 80.
DETX  The via is set to have a radius of 0.1 mm and a length of 0.1 mm.
DETX  FIG. 9 shows a simulation result comparing the coaxial cable 10 with the
      cylindrical electromagnetic bandgap 20 according to the embodiment of the
      present disclosure. As seen, the electromagnetic noise transfer
      characteristic is reduced compared to a conventional coaxial cable by
      more than 20 dB (marked as dotted line on FIG. 9) in frequencies in the
      range of approximately 5 GHz to approximately 6 GHz, which corresponds to
      a wireless LAN (local area network) band.
DETX  Therefore, in a case when the coaxial cable 10 is adopted with the
      cylindrical electromagnetic bandgap 20, it is determined that a reception
      of the WLAN band can be improved by more than 20 dB compared to a
      conventional coaxial cable.
DETX  In addition, the frequency characteristic of such frequency band can be
      changed by adjusting an area, a thickness, or a gap of each of the
      conductor patch 21 and the via 22 that together form the cylindrical
      electromagnetic bandgap 20.
DETX  Referring to FIGS. 10 and 11, a cylindrical electromagnetic bandgap
      according to an embodiment of the present disclosure has a stacking
      structure that covers an outer side of the cylindrical electromagnetic
      bandgap 20 that covers the coaxial cable 10.
DETX  The cylindrical electromagnetic bandgap with a stacking structure
      includes a first cylindrical electromagnetic bandgap 20 that is formed in
      a cylindrical shape to cover the outer conductor 10b of the coaxial cable
      10, and a second cylindrical electromagnetic bandgap 20a that covers the
      first cylindrical electromagnetic bandgap 20.
DETX  The second cylindrical electromagnetic bandgap 20a also includes a
      conductor patch 21a having a curved surface and a via 22a connecting the
      conductor patch 21a to the outer conductor 10b of the cylindrical cable
      10.
DETX  A gap (g) is present between a plurality of conductor patches 21 of the
      first cylindrical electromagnetic bandgap 20. The via 22a of the second
      cylindrical electromagnetic bandgap 20a is inserted into the gap (g) and
      connects an outer conductor 10b of the coaxial cable 10 to a conductor
      patch 21a of the second cylindrical electromagnetic bandgap 20a both
      structurally and electrically.
DETX  The second cylindrical electromagnetic bandgap 20a is provided so that a
      portion of the conductor patch 21a of the second cylindrical
      electromagnetic bandgap 20a overlaps with a portion of the conductor
      patch 21 of the first cylindrical electromagnetic bandgap 20, and
      therefore, has a characteristic as a bandgap for broadband
      electromagnetic waves.
DETX  Between the first and the second cylindrical electromagnetic bandgaps 20
      and 20a and the coaxial cable 10, that is, between each conductor patch
      21 and 21a and the outer conductor patch 10b, the dielectric D2 or
      ferrite material F can be formed. Therefore, the first and second
      cylindrical electromagnetic bandgaps 20 and 20a can have a characteristic
      in reduced electromagnetic waves both in a low frequency band and in a
      high frequency band.
DETX  Although a few embodiments of the present disclosure have been shown and
      described, it would be appreciated by those skilled in the art that
      changes may be made in these embodiments without departing from the
      principles and spirit of the disclosure, the scope of which is defined in
      the claims and their equivalents. For example, the cylindrical
      electromagnetic bandgap of the present disclosure can be applied to a
      cylindrical cable by use of a structure and material that can block the
      flow of organic currents instead of a conductor patch and a via.
      Therefore, changes and modifications made in these embodiments without
      departing from the principles and spirit of the disclosure are to be
      included in the claim.

      and then moves from the lower right corner to an upper right corner.
      Finally, the testing rod 76 moves from the upper right corner to a lower
      left corner, so as to ensure that a touch function can operate normally
      in all positions of the touchpad 512. As shown in FIG. 8, the testing rod
      76 is further for testing the fingerprint identification module 513 of
      the portable electronic device 51. In this embodiment, an end of the
      testing rod 76 for contacting against the touch module is made of
      conductive material with a print. Therefore, the testing rod 76 with the
      print can be simulated as the human's fingerprint. The control unit 70 is
      further for controlling the fourth driving mechanism 74 to drive the
      testing rod 76, so that the end of the testing rod 76 contacts against
      the fingerprint identification module 513 of the portable electronic
      device 51, so as to achieve a purpose of testing whether the fingerprint
      identification module 513 operates normally.

      another view according to the embodiment of the present invention. The
      testing system 50 can further include a distance sensing unit 78
      electrically connected to the control unit 70. The distance sensing unit
      78 is disposed on an end of the platform 58 nearby the portable
      electronic device 51 for sensing a distance between a display module 514
      of the portable electronic device 51 and the end of the platform 58, and
      the control unit 70 is further for controlling the operation of the
      testing system 50 according to a sensing result of the distance sensing
      unit. In a procedure of controlling the first driving mechanism 60 to
      drive the platform 58 to move in the first direction (.+-.X direction) by
      the control unit 70, the control unit 70 further controls the distance
      sensing unit 78 to sense the distance between the display module 514 and
      the end of the platform 58. As the sensed distance between the display
      module 514 and the end of the platform 58 is less than a predetermined
      distance, the control unit 70 stops the operation of the first driving
      mechanism 60 accordingly, so as to prevent the platform 58 from colliding
      the display module 514 of the portable electronic device 51. In this
      embodiment, the distance sensing unit 78 can be an ultrasound sensing
      device, but is not limited to it. All devices capable of sensing the
      distance are within the scope of the present invention. For example, the
      distance sensing unit 78 also can be a laser sensing device.

      an image capturing module 515 of the portable electronic device 51
      captures the image reflected by the reflecting component 82, so as to
      determine whether the display module 514 and the image capturing module
      515 operate normally according to the image reflected by the reflecting
      component 82 and captured by the image capturing module 515. For example,
      it can analyze whether the image captured by the image capturing module
      515 is abnormal by the software embedded in the portable electronic
      device 51, so as to test whether the image capturing module 515 captures
      the image correctly and whether the display module 514 displays the image
      normally.

      positioning components 862 are disposed on the supporting component 86,
      and four openings 517 are disposed on the portable electronic device 51.
      Amounts and positions of the positioning component 862 and the opening
      517 are not limited to this embodiment, and it depends on practical
      design demands.
DETX  Furthermore, as shown in FIG. 11 and FIG. 12, the testing system 50 of
      the present invention further includes a foolproof unit 90 disposed on
      the supporting component 86 and electrically connected to the control
      unit 70. The foolproof unit 90 is for generating a signal as the portable
      electronic device 51 is disposed on the supporting component 86 to press
      the foolproof unit 90, and the control unit 70 is further for controlling
      the plug testing unit 84 as receiving the signal generated by the
      foolproof unit 90. In this embodiment, the testing system 50 of the
      present invention includes two foolproof units 90, but is not limited to
      it. As the portable electronic device 51 is disposed on the supporting
      component 86 correctly and is perpendicular to the supporting component
      86 exactly, the two foolproof units 90 are activated to generate the
      signal to the control unit 70. At this time, the control unit 70 can
      determine that the portable electronic device 51 is positioned on the
      supporting component 86 exactly, and then the control unit 70 controls
      the plug module 88 to perform the testing operation. However, as the
      portable electronic device 51 is disposed on the supporting component 86,
      but the portable electronic device 51 does not contact the two foolproof
      units 90 at the same time, it means that the portable electronic device
      51 is not disposed on the portable electronic device 51 correctly.
      Therefore, the control unit 70 does not control the plug module 88 to
      perform the testing operation, so that it can prevent the plug module 88
      from scratching the appearance of the portable electronic device 51.
DETX  In contrast to the prior art, the testing system of the present invention
      includes the first driving mechanism, the second driving mechanism, the
      third driving mechanism and the control unit. As the control unit
      controls the first driving mechanism to drive the platform to get close
      to the portable electronic device, and the control unit controls the
      second driving mechanism and the third driving mechanism to drive the
      locating component to press the portable electronic device, so that it
      can test whether the keyboard module, the touch module, the fingerprint
      identification module, the display module and the image capturing module
      operate normally. In addition, the testing system further includes the
      plug testing unit, and the control unit controls the plug testing unit to
      test whether the sockets of the portable electronic device operate
      normally. Therefore, the testing system of the present invention can
      solve the conventional problem that all tests have to be performed by the
      operator in factory, resulting in wasting a lot of manpower and time.
DETX  Those skilled in the art will readily observe that numerous modifications
      and alterations of the device and method may be made while retaining the
      teachings of the invention. Accordingly, the above disclosure should be
      construed as limited only by the metes and bounds of the appended claims.

EXP Cheung; Chun
ABPR  A miniature component carrier includes a thin, resilient mask through
      which are formed multiple spaced-apart apertures each of which is sized
      and shaped to compliantly receive and hold a miniature component in a
      controlled orientation during termination processing such that the side
      margins of the aperture primarily contact and grip the corner regions of
      the miniature component. At least some of the apertures have side margins
      that form rhomboidal or elliptical apertures. The shape and size of the
      multiple spaced-apart apertures confine within an operational tolerance
      contact between the side margins of the aperture and the side or end wall
      surfaces of the electronic component. This reduces mechanical damage to
      the side and end wall surfaces that results from their contact with the
      side margins during receipt and gripping of the miniature component in
      the aperture.

BSTX TECHNICAL FIELD
BSTX  This disclosure relates to a carrier for miniature components and, in
      particular, to a miniature component carrier having dimensionally precise
      slots shaped to grip the corners of a miniature electronic component and
      hold it in a controlled orientation without damaging the electrically
      conductive portions of the electronic component.
BSTX BACKGROUND INFORMATION
BSTX  Computers and other electronic equipment are becoming more powerful and
      can perform a wider range of tasks. These increases in power and
      applicability result at least in part from an increase in the number of
      miniature electronic components included in each computer or other piece
      of electronic equipment. To help minimize the sizes of the computers and
      other electronic equipment and to facilitate their operation at higher
      speeds, electronic circuits used in computers and other electronic
      equipment include miniature electronic components positioned in high
      density packing arrangements.
BSTX  One such miniature electronic component, a solid state capacitor, is a
      tiny rectangular "chip" that is smaller than a grain of rice. FIG. 1
      shows a capacitor chip 10 that has a solid enclosed body 12 of square or
      rectangular cross section and made of ceramic or other dielectric
      material. Body 12 includes opposed upper and lower surfaces 14 and 16
      spaced apart by a body thickness 18 and bound by opposed side wall
      surfaces 22 and 24 and opposed end wall surfaces 26 and 28. The linear
      region along which two edges of any of the surfaces (e.g., upper, lower,
      side wall, or end wall surfaces) meet and form an angle is called a
      corner region 32. Capacitor chip 10 includes multiple linear corner
      regions 32, such as, for example, (1) corner regions 32 defined by the
      intersection of an edge of upper surface 14 with an edge of one of side
      wall surfaces 22 and 24 or one of end wall surfaces 26 and 28, (2) corner
      regions 32 defined by the intersection of an edge of lower surface 16
      with an edge of one of side wall surfaces 22 and 24 or one of end wall
      surfaces 26 and 28, and (3) corner regions 32 defined by the intersection
      of an edge of one of side wall surfaces 22 and 24 with an edge of one of
      end wall surfaces 26 and 28. Linear corner regions 32 may also include
      the point at which three edges meet, such as, for example, the point at
      which an edge of upper surface 14 meets with an edge of each of side wall
      surface 22 and end wall surface 26.
BSTX  Capacitor chip 10 contains within body thickness 18 multiple spaced-apart
      metal plates (not shown). One terminal end of each of alternate metal
      plates is connected to the exterior of body 12 and is adapted by a
      metallizing process to form a pair of spaced-apart mutually opposed
      electronic contact surfaces or ends 36. One or more of contact surfaces
      36 of capacitor chip 10 are striped with a solderable paste that is dried
      and then fired to produce surfaces that can later be soldered directly
      onto a circuit board. This process is commonly referred to as
      "termination." U.S. Pat. No. 5,226,382 describes a machine for placing a
      stripe or trace of solderable paste on the contact surfaces of a chip and
      drying the paste so that the paste can later be fired. This machine uses
      a metal carrier belt or tape in which slotted rubber masks are formed.
      Apertures in the masks receive chips in position for processing, such as
      covering opposed ends of the chips with solderable paste.
BSTX  A relatively new miniature electronic component, an integrated passive
      component (IPC) or array chip, is composed of multiple circuit components
      fit into a single array chip that is simultaneously solderable to one of
      a number of different electronic circuits. This device is called an
      "array chip" because it comprises a plurality or an array of circuit
      components, such as four or five separate capacitors stacked together in
      a single chip. U.S. Pat. No. 5,863,331 describes a machine for placing
      stripes of solderable paste on the contact surfaces of a chip array.
BSTX  FIG. 2A shows a typical array chip 40 with its side wall surfaces 22 and
      24 covered with stripes 42 of solderable paste. Optionally, end wall
      surfaces 26 and 28 may be covered with stripes 42 of solderable paste
      (not shown). Array chip 40 has overall dimensions such as 3.2 mm (0.125
      in) long and 1.5 mm (0.060 in) wide upper and lower surfaces 14 and 16;
      1.5 mm (0.060 in) wide and 0.8 mm (0.031 in) high opposed end wall
      surfaces 26 and 28; and 0.8 mm (0.031 in) high and 3.2 mm (0.125 in) long
      opposed side wall surfaces 22 and 24. Where both end wall surfaces and
      side wall surfaces include stripes 42 of solderable paste, formation of
      stripes 42 on end wall surfaces 26 and 28 may occur before or after
      formation of stripes 42 on side wall surfaces 22 and 24.
BSTX  FIG. 2B shows that installing array chip 40 into an electronic circuit
      entails placing separate solderable paste stripes 42 along opposite wall
      surfaces, such as side wall surfaces 22 and 24 (as shown) or end wall
      surfaces 26 and 28 (not shown), and soldering paste stripes 42 to copper
      traces 44 formed on a circuit board 46. The width of each stripe 42 is
      typically set at 0.38.+-.0.18 mm (0.015.+-.0.007 in), with a 0.3.+-.0.18
      mm (0.012.+-.0.007 in) turn-down edge at the end of each stripe 42 along
      the adjacent wall as shown on respective upper and lower surfaces 14 and
      16 in FIG. 2A. As with other electronic components, after the paste is
      applied, it is subjected to a heat-drying cycle to set the paste and
      thereafter to a firing cycle to fuse the paste on array chip 40.
BSTX  The small size of an array chip and the small differences between its
      width and height dimensions raise the importance of handling the array
      chip and its insertion into the mask of a carrier belt or tape. The
      multiple stripes are placed on only the appropriate circuit board
      surfaces, and their placement is accomplished with extreme accuracy.
      Splashing of the paste onto other surfaces of the array chip would
      provide a site for a short circuit and thereby significantly degrade
      electronic equipment function. Accordingly, a feed device places the
      array chip onto the carrier belt in a correct position and location, and
      the array chip is handled correctly so that the appropriate surface is
      exposed in proper orientation to receive the paste stripes within a
      specified accuracy.
BSTX  Typically, miniature component carriers that transport miniature
      electronic components and present them for processing include an endless
      belt or tape that carries multiple miniature electronic components, such
      as capacitor chips 10 and array chips 40. The endless tape is formed with
      a plurality of transversely oriented, elongated apertures arranged
      centrally between and uniformly spaced apart along the marginal edges of
      the tape. Each of the apertures is adapted to receive in coplanar fixed
      registration a thin, resilient mask having at least one aperture, and
      preferably multiple apertures, of a size and shape to compliantly receive
      and hold the miniature components in a specific orientation so that the
      surfaces intended for termination extend outwardly from the mask. The
      term "mask" is used in the art to define an element made of silicone
      rubber, or other resilient material, that surrounds and partly encloses
      an electronic component during some stage of its fabrication process. The
      purpose of a mask is to provide a generally elongated, resilient-walled
      holder in which an electronic component may be temporarily held during
      the process of metallizing its opposite ends.
BSTX  FIG. 3 shows an exemplary endless belt-type component carrier having a
      flexible metal tape 50 formed of stainless steel or other high-strength
      metal. Tape 50 is approximately 0.13 mm (0.005 in) thick and about 5.1 cm
      (2.0 in) wide and is of an "endless" variety in that it has no beginning
      or end but is maneuvered about a series of pulleys and sprocket wheels
      between various processing stations, as is described in U.S. Pat. No.
      5,226,382. Tape 50 is defined by multiple spaced-apart, mutually parallel
      side margins 52 and 54 and includes a series of pilot or sprocket holes
      56 that serve as drive perforations to receive drive stubs of drive
      sprocket wheels (not shown). Sprocket holes 56 are disposed adjacent to
      at least one and preferably both of side margins 52 and 54 and are
      uniformly spaced along the length of tape 50.
BSTX  As shown in FIGS. 3-6, tape 50 is formed with a variety of first
      apertures 60 of different shape and size into which a thin, resilient
      mask 66 can be inserted. Each of first apertures 60 is adapted to receive
      in coplanar fixed registration mask 66, which includes one or more second
      apertures 74 and preferably a series of second apertures 74 of sizes and
      shapes to compliantly receive multiple electronic components in specific
      orientation so that their end surfaces intended for termination extend
      outwardly from mask 66.
BSTX  First apertures 60 are preferably formed in discrete patterns and are
      preferably spaced centrally between and uniformly along the marginal
      edges of tape 50. First apertures 60 are typically a series of closely
      spaced round openings as shown in FIG. 3, a series of elongated
      rectangular openings as shown in the end portions of FIG. 4, or a series
      of elongated openings in repeated patterns in a side-by-side arrangement
      as shown in the center portion of FIG. 4. In a configuration of other
      than round holes, first apertures 60 are generally defined by a pair of
      spaced-apart, elongated side edges 62 bound by a pair of short-end edges
      64. Each of first apertures 60 receives a mask 66 that is of a size and
      shape to remain fixed to tape 50 and to carry multiple electronic
      components.
BSTX  Mask 66 is preferably formed of silicone rubber, but may be formed of any
      conventional elastomeric material having sufficient elasticity to receive
      and grip a miniature component in a controlled orientation. FIGS. 7A and
      7B show that mask 66 is defined by a pair of spaced-apart top and bottom
      exterior surfaces 70 and 72 that, when mask 66 is fixed in place on tape
      50, lie coplanar with and, respectively, above and below the surfaces of
      tape 50. In its simplest form, shown in FIG. 3, each mask 66 is cast in
      place about a first aperture 60 so that a plurality of masks 66 may be
      arranged in a pattern parallel or transverse to the longitudinal axis of
      tape 50. One or more second apertures 74 of a size smaller than that of
      first aperture 60 are formed in each mask 66 to keep the metal core of
      tape 50 out of contact with the electronic component. The size of second
      apertures 74 is slightly smaller than that of the electronic component in
      at least one direction so that the electronic component can be
      positionally accepted and resistively grasped during advancement of the
      electronic component from one processing stage to another. Mask 66 is
      defined by, in addition to respective top and bottom surfaces 70 and 72,
      a pair of opposed elongated slots 76 positioned intermediate of
      respective top and bottom surfaces 70 and 72 for receipt of elongated
      side edges 62 of first aperture 60 formed in tape 50. The length of
      removable mask 66 is less than the width of tape 50 and is preferably
      less than the distance between adjacent sprocket holes 56.
BSTX  FIGS. 8A and 8B are, respectively, plan and enlarged fragmentary views of
      an alternative component carrier tape 50' that is similar to tape 50,
      with the exception that silicone rubber masks 66' molded into or coated
      over first apertures 60' are of generally rectangular shape with curved
      ends in a core portion. Second apertures 74' are formed in a single row
      in each mask 66' along the width of carrier tape 50'.
BSTX  FIGS. 7A, 7B, and 9 show masks 66 having second apertures 74 of different
      geometries. Mask 66 of FIG. 7A includes a series of closely spaced second
      apertures 74 of round shape. These second apertures 74 include a single,
      closed curvilinear side margin 78.
BSTX  Mask 66 of FIG. 7B includes two second apertures 74 of "sawtooth" shape,
      each of which is capable of holding multiple electronic components. Each
      sawtooth-shaped second aperture 74 is an elongated aperture having
      multiple side margins 78 that form multiple resilient teeth 82 that
      extend into second aperture 74, as is more fully described in U.S. Pat.
      No. 5,226,382. The arrangement of side margins 78 of sawtooth-shaped
      second aperture 74 forms multiple individual openings 80, each of which
      is capable of holding a single electronic component.
BSTX  Mask 66 of FIG. 9 includes multiple second apertures 74 of a "dog bone"
      or "bow tie" shape and including opposed side margins 88 separated along
      their lengths by longer distances at opposite ends 90 and by a shorter
      distance at a medial location 92 between ends 90. In a preferred
      embodiment, the slot distances become gradually smaller from opposite
      ends 90 to medial location 92.
BSTX  An array electronic component is held in the second aperture under
      compression by an interference fit. For example, a 0.05 mm (0.002 in)
      desired interference fit nominally requires a .+-.0.025 mm (.+-.0.001 in)
      second aperture tolerance range, and a 0.51 mm (0.02 in) thick array
      electronic component typically requires a 0.43-0.48 mm (0.017-0.019 in)
      second aperture. A less than -0.025 mm (-0.001 in) second aperture width
      tolerance results in a second aperture that is too tight, causing the
      silicone rubber nubs of the second aperture to deflect (rather than
      compress) and thereby cant the array electronic component held in the
      second aperture. A second aperture opening width of greater than 0.025 mm
      (0.001 in) lets the component fall out of the belt.
BSTX  When loaded, individual electronic components must be centered in two
      directions (horizontally and vertically) within a second aperture.
      Currently available loading techniques require two processing steps to
      correctly position an electronic component within each second aperture.
      First, an electronic component is loaded into a second aperture such that
      the electronic component is centered in only one direction, typically
      horizontally. Second, the electronic component is centered between the
      top and bottom exterior surfaces of the mask. Exemplary secondary
      operations include, for example, (1) exposing the electronic component to
      a high-pressure gust of air that forces the electronic component into the
      desired alignment and (2) mechanically pushing the electronic component
      into the desired alignment, as described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,863,331 and
      5,226,382. Both of these exemplary secondary operations involve contact
      with the loaded electronic component. Further, because of the tight fit
      of the electronic component in the second aperture, a significant amount
      of force is required to center the electronic component. Consequently,
      the secondary operation often results in mechanical damage to the loaded
      component. Further, the secondary operation is an additional processing
      step that requires the use of additional machinery and increases
      processing time for each electronic component.
BSTX  Also, some of the prior art second aperture geometries, e.g., the
      sawtooth formation shown in FIG. 7B, do not consistently hold electronic
      components in the desired orientation, causing them to move during
      processing and thereby reducing the overall yield of usable electronic
      components. With specific reference to the sawtooth formation shown in
      FIG. 7B, this is so because each of the individual openings that comprise
      the elongated second aperture have incongruous side margins and thus lack
      sufficient aperture side margin grip to tightly and securely hold
      multiple electronic components.
BSTX  Additionally, because the second apertures are shaped such that the sides
      of the electronic component tightly contact the side margins of the
      second aperture, the electrically conductive portions of the electronic
      components can be damaged during processing. Further, removing the
      terminated electronic components from the second apertures as shown in
      U.S. Pat. No. 5,863,331 requires a significant amount of force because of
      the tight fit necessary to hold the electronic component in the desired
      orientation during processing. This force can mechanically damage the
      terminated electronic component, thereby reducing the overall yield of
      usable electronic components. Further, during the receipt, gripping,
      positioning, and ejection processes, the terminated electronic component
      may be subject to smearing of the conductive stripes 42 as the electronic
      components slide along the side margins of the second aperture, which
      degrades the finished component's performance.
BSTX  In the case of using a round second aperture 74, as shown in FIG. 7A, the
      side margins of the second aperture tightly contact the side and end wall
      surfaces of the electronic component, and any previously formed
      electrically conductive stripes on the electronic components can be
      damaged during receipt of the electronic component into the second
      aperture. Further, the method of removing the terminated electronic
      components from the second apertures described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,863,331
      requires a significant amount of force because of the tight fit necessary
      to hold the electronic component in the desired orientation during
      processing. Application of this force can result in mechanical damage to
      the terminated electronic component, thereby reducing the overall yield
      of usable electronic components. Further, the terminated electronic
      component may be subject to smearing of the conductive stripes as they
      slide along the side margins of the second aperture.
BSTX  What is needed, therefore, is a mask including miniature component
      apertures capable of receiving in a single step miniature electronic
      components and of gripping them in a controlled orientation during
      termination of the ends of the electronic components without damaging
      their electrically conductive portions.
BSTX SUMMARY OF THE DISCLOSURE
BSTX  A miniature electronic component carrier capable of receiving and holding
      multiple miniature components includes a thin, resilient mask through
      which are formed multiple spaced-apart apertures each of which has a
      periphery that is sized and shaped to compliantly receive and grip a
      miniature electronic component in a controlled orientation during
      termination processing. This controlled orientation ensures that the
      electronic component surfaces intended for termination (e.g., the upper
      and lower surfaces of a chip capacitor and the side wall surfaces of a
      chip array) extend outwardly from the mask. In some embodiments, the
      apertures have peripheries that form rhomboidal or elliptical apertures.
      The shapes of the peripheries of these apertures facilitate placement of
      a miniature electronic component in each aperture such that component
      holding regions of the periphery of the aperture contact and grip
      primarily the corner regions of the miniature electronic component. The
      shapes and sizes of the peripheries of the multiple spaced-apart
      apertures confine gripped electronic components by contact within an
      operational tolerance with any one of the side and end wall surfaces of
      the electronic components to prevent mechanical damage to the side and
      end wall surfaces resulting from their contact with the peripheries
      during receipt, gripping, positioning, and ejection of the miniature
      electronic components.
BSTX  Some embodiments of the miniature electronic component carrier may also
      include one or more relief openings that extend from or are adjacent to
      the apertures. The relief openings facilitate temporary deformation of
      the resilient mask during receipt and gripping of a miniature electronic
      component. One exemplary type of relief opening is a slot that extends
      outwardly from a vertex of a rhomboidal aperture. Another exemplary type
      of relief opening includes one or more relief opening side margins that
      form a square, rectangular, circular, triangular, elliptical,
      trapezoidal, curved, or semicircular relief opening. This type of relief
      opening is positioned adjacent to a side margin of a rhomboidal or
      elliptical aperture.
BSTX  Additional aspects and advantages will be apparent from the following
      detailed description of preferred embodiments, which proceeds with

DETX DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS
DETX  When used in reference to a mask, the term "apertures" refers to the
      above-described second apertures. Preferred embodiments of a miniature
      component carrier include a thin, resilient mask through which are formed
      multiple spaced-apart apertures each of which has a periphery that is
      sized and shaped to compliantly receive and grip the corner regions of a
      miniature electronic component. Gripping the corner region limits contact
      between component holding regions of the periphery of each aperture and
      the side and end wall surfaces of each gripped electronic component.
      Limiting such contact reduces mechanical damage to the side and end wall
      surfaces resulting from their contact with the periphery during receipt,
      gripping, positioning, and ejection of the miniature component. The shape
      and size of each aperture also ensure that the electronic component
      gripped and held by the aperture maintains a controlled orientation
      during termination processing. This controlled orientation ensures that
      the surfaces intended for termination (i.e., the upper and lower surfaces
      of a capacitor chip and the side wall surfaces of an array chip) extend
      outwardly from the mask. Exemplary aperture shapes that facilitate
      receipt and grip of the corner regions of a miniature electronic
      component include substantially rhomboidal and elliptical apertures.
DETX  FIG. 10 shows a mask 100 that includes multiple apertures of various
      geometries. Skilled persons will recognize that, in practice, masks for
      use in miniature component carriers typically include multiple apertures
      having a single geometry. The depiction in FIG. 10 of a carrier tape
      having apertures of various geometries is meant to show some exemplary
      embodiments of apertures that may be formed in mask 100.
DETX  A leftmost aperture 104.sub.1 in mask 100 has four linear side margins
      102 that form a rhomboidal aperture 104 having four vertices 105. The
      term "rhomboidal" refers to a parallelogram with unequal adjacent sides,
      such as a rhombus, diamond, or rhomboid. FIG. 11 is an enlarged plan view
      of an electronic component 106 seated within rhomboidal aperture
      104.sub.1 of FIG. 10. A portion of each aperture side margin 102 forms a
      linear holding region 108 where aperture side margin 102 contacts a
      corner region 110 of electronic component 106. As stated above, corner
      region 110 is a linear region along which two edges of any of the
      surfaces (e.g., upper, lower, side wall, or end wall surfaces) of
      electronic component 106 meet and form an angle. Corner region 110 may
      include the point at which three of the edges meet, such as, for example,
      the point at which an edge of the upper surface meets an edge of a side
      wall surface and an edge of an end wall surface. In addition to
      contacting corner region 110, holding region 108 may contact a minimal
      portion (e.g., 7%) of side wall surfaces 22 and 24 and/or end wall
      surfaces 26 and 28 of electronic component 106. The 7% overlap of holding
      region 108 and side wall surfaces 22 and 24 and/or end wall surfaces 26
      and 28 represents an operational tolerance beyond which undesirable
      damage to the side and end wall surfaces of the electronic component may
      result. An overlap of greater than 7% will result in excessive
      interference between holding region 108 and stripes 42.
DETX  When seated in rhomboidal aperture 104.sub.1, electronic component 106
      places mechanical stress or pressure on holding regions 108 of side
      margins 102. To reduce the amount of mechanical stress on holding regions
      108, relief openings 114 provided in mask 100 facilitate temporary
      deformation of mask 100 during receipt and gripping of miniature
      electronic component 106. Apertures 104.sub.2-104.sub.9 shown in FIG. 10
      include relief openings 114. Relief openings 114.sub.s shown in FIG. 10
      are slots that extend outwardly from at least one of vertices 105 of
      rhomboidal aperture 104. The length of each slot-type relief opening
      114.sub.s is preferably between about 10% and 100% of the length of one
      of side margins 102. In the embodiments shown in FIG. 10, slot-type
      relief openings 114.sub.s include a bulbous hole 118. Slot-type relief
      openings 114.sub.s may be formed without bulbous hole 118. Although each
      of apertures 104.sub.2-104.sub.9 shown in FIG. 10 includes multiple
      slot-type relief openings 114.sub.s, some embodiments of aperture 104 may
      include only a single slot-type relief opening 114.sub.s. In embodiments
      where an even number of slot-type relief openings 114.sub.s are present,
      they preferably extend from opposed vertices 105 of aperture 104.
DETX  A rightmost aperture 120.sub.10 shown in FIG. 10 includes curved side
      margins 102.sub.1 and 102.sub.2 that are of convex shape curving outward
      relative to the aperture interior and are portions of a single, closed
      curvilinear side margin 102 that forms an elliptical aperture 120 having
      a major axis 122 and a minor axis 124 (shown in FIG. 12). Elliptical
      aperture 120.sub.10 has sufficient eccentricity to confine within the
      operational tolerance described above contact between side margins 102 of
      aperture 120 and side wall surfaces 22 and 24 and end wall surfaces 26
      and 28 of electronic component 106. Some embodiments of elliptical
      apertures 120 are of a rhomboidal-ellipsis shape. FIG. 12 is an enlarged
      diagram of electronic component 106 seated within elliptical aperture
      120.sub.10 of FIG. 10. Portions of side margin 102 of elliptical aperture
      120 form holding regions 108 where aperture side margin 102 contacts
      corner region 110 of electronic component 106. As stated above, in
      addition to contacting corner region 110, holding region 108 may contact
      a minimal portion (e.g., 7%) of side wall surfaces 22 and 24 and/or end
      wall surfaces 26 and 28 of electronic component 106.
DETX  FIGS. 13A and 13B show masks 100 that include multiple aperture/relief
      opening combinations each of which have a different geometry. As stated
      above, skilled persons will recognize that, in practice, masks for use in
      miniature component carriers typically include a single aperture/relief
      opening geometry. The depiction in FIGS. 13A and 13B of a carrier tape
      having aperture/relief opening combinations of various geometries is
      meant to show some exemplary aperture/relief opening combinations that
      may be formed in mask 100. The exemplary relief openings shown in FIGS.
      13A and 13B include relief opening side margins that form, for example,
      square, rectangular, circular, triangular, elliptical, semicircular,
      curved, and trapezoidal relief openings. Any of the exemplary relief
      openings shown in FIGS. 13A and 13B may be positioned adjacent to at
      least one side margin 102 or vertex 105 of either of rhomboidal aperture
      104 or elliptical aperture 120. Skilled persons will recognize that
      additional relief opening geometries that are not shown in FIGS. 13A and
      13B may be formed.
DETX  To reduce the number of reference numerals shown in FIGS. 13A and 13B,
      reference numerals 102 (referring to the aperture side margins) and 105
      (referring to a vertex of a rhomboidal aperture) are not shown.
DETX  A leftmost aperture 104.sub.11 in mask 100 of FIG. 13A has four linear
      side margins 102 that form a rhomboidal aperture 104. Aperture 104.sub.11

      Each of the four rectangular relief openings 127 includes four linear
      relief opening side margins 126, one of which is positioned adjacent to a
      linear side margin 102 of aperture 104. In some embodiments, the length
      of each relief opening side margin 126 is equal to or less than the
      length of each side margin 102. Skilled persons will recognize that
      rectangular relief openings 127 may be square relief openings. Further,
      skilled persons will recognize that substantially rhomboidal aperture 104
      may be replaced with elliptical aperture 120.
DETX  An aperture/relief opening combination 130 in mask 100 of FIG. 13A

      of triangular relief openings 132 includes three linear relief opening
      side margins 126 that form a right triangle whose hypotenutical side
      margin 133 is positioned adjacent to a linear side margin 102 of aperture
      104. Skilled persons will recognize that triangular relief openings 132
      are not limited to right triangles and that any of the legs of triangular
      relief openings 132 may be positioned adjacent to side margins 102 of
      aperture 104. Further, skilled persons will recognize that substantially
      rhomboidal aperture 104 may be replaced with elliptical aperture 120.
DETX  An aperture/relief opening combination 136 in mask 100 of FIG. 13A

      Each of the four semicircular relief openings 140 includes a curvilinear
      relief opening side margin 142 and a linear relief opening side margin
      144. Linear relief opening side margin 144 is positioned adjacent to
      linear side margin 102 of aperture 104. Skilled persons will recognize
      that curvilinear relief opening side margin 142 may be positioned
      adjacent to linear side margin 102 of aperture 104 and that substantially
      rhomboidal aperture 104 may be replaced with elliptical aperture 120.
DETX  An aperture/relief opening combination 148 in mask 100 of FIG. 13A
      includes an aperture that has four linear side margins 102 and four
      rounded vertices 105 that form a substantially rhomboidal aperture 104.
      Adjacent to each side margin 102 is a generally trapezoidal relief
      opening 150. Each of the four trapezoidal relief openings 150 includes
      two spaced-apart, parallel relief opening side margins 152 and two end
      relief opening side margins 154. As shown in FIG. 13A, the longer of the
      two spaced-apart, parallel relief opening side margins 152 is positioned
      adjacent to linear side margins 102 of substantially rhomboidal aperture
      104. Skilled persons will recognize that either of the parallel side
      margins 152 or either of the end relief opening side margins 154 may be
      positioned adjacent to side margins 102. Further, skilled persons will
      recognize that substantially rhomboidal aperture 104 may be replaced with
      elliptical aperture 120.
DETX  An aperture/relief opening combination 158 in mask 100 of FIG. 13A
      includes an aperture that has four linear side margins 102 and four
      rounded vertices 105 that form a substantially rhomboidal aperture 104.
      Adjacent to each of two opposed vertices 105 is a curved, or arc-shaped,
      relief opening 160. Each of the two curved relief openings 160 includes
      two curvilinear relief opening side margins 162, two end relief opening
      side margins 164, and an apex region 166. Apex region 166 of each curved
      relief opening 160 is positioned adjacent to opposed ones of vertices
      105. Skilled persons will recognize that curvilinear relief opening side
      margins 162 may be positioned in other locations, such as, for example,
      adjacent to linear side margins 102 of substantially rhomboidal aperture
      104 and adjacent to each of vertices 105 of substantially rhomboidal
      aperture 104.
DETX  An aperture/relief opening combination 168 in mask 100 of FIG. 13B
      includes elliptical aperture 120 and two curved relief openings 160
      positioned adjacent to curvilinear side margin 102. Each of the curved
      relief openings 160 includes two curvilinear relief opening side margins
      162, two end relief opening side margins 164, and an apex region 166.
      Each curved relief opening 160 is positioned adjacent to side margin 102
      of aperture 120 such that major axis 122 (not shown) intersects apex
      region 166 of each curved relief opening 160. Skilled persons will
      recognize that curvilinear relief opening side margins 162 may be
      positioned in other locations, such as, for example, intersecting minor
      axis 124 (not shown) of elliptical aperture 120.
DETX  An aperture/relief opening combination 169 in mask 100 of FIG. 13B
      includes elliptical aperture 120 and four triangular relief openings 132
      positioned adjacent to curvilinear side margin 102. One of the three
      linear relief opening side margins 126 of each of the four triangular
      relief openings 132 is positioned adjacent to a curvilinear side margin
      102 of aperture 120. Further, triangular relief openings 132 are
      positioned such that they intersect neither major axis 122 (not shown)
      nor minor axis 124 (not shown) of elliptical aperture 120. Skilled
      persons will recognize that triangular relief openings 132 may be
      positioned along either or both of major and minor axes 122 and 124 (not
      shown) and that a vertex 174 of each triangular relief opening may be
      positioned adjacent to side margins 102 of aperture 120.
DETX  An aperture/relief opening combination 170 in mask 100 of FIG. 13B
      includes an aperture that has four linear side margins 102 and two
      opposed rounded vertices 105 that form a substantially rhomboidal
      aperture 104. Adjacent to each side margin 102 is a circular relief
      opening 172. Each of the four circular relief openings 172 is positioned
      adjacent to a different one of the four linear side margins 102 of
      substantially rhomboidal aperture 104. Also, two slot-type relief
      openings 114.sub.s extend from opposed vertices 105 of substantially
      rhomboidal aperture 104. Skilled persons will recognize that slot-type
      relief openings 114.sub.s may extend from fewer or more of vertices 105
      and that substantially rhomboidal aperture 104 may be replaced with
      elliptical aperture 120.
DETX  An aperture/relief opening combination 176 in mask 100 of FIG. 13B
      includes elliptical aperture 120 and two slot-type relief openings
      114.sub.s extending generally along major axis 122 (not shown) of
      elliptical aperture 120. Each of the two slot-type relief openings
      114.sub.s includes bulbous hole 118 on their ends. The right-most
      aperture in mask 100 of FIG. 13B is an elliptical aperture 120 without a
      relief opening.
DETX  Apertures 104 and 120 may be formed in mask 100 by laser processing,
      molding, and die punching. One exemplary method of laser processing is
      described in U.S. Pat. No. 6,919,532, which is assigned to the assignee
      of the present application. In this method of laser processing, an
      ultraviolet (UV) laser beam is directed to cut through a component
      carrier mask made of thin elastomeric material to form apertures having
      the desired shape and size. A preferred embodiment uses a UV laser beam
      to form by ablation multiple apertures in a resilient mask made of
      elastomeric material. Ablation of the elastomeric material, which is
      preferably silicone rubber, ensures formation of apertures of the
      required shape and dimensional quality. The absorption of conventional
      elastomeric materials, including silicone rubber, at the UV laser
      ablation wavelength region (shorter than about 400 nm) is insufficiently
      strong to cut apertures at commercially acceptable throughput rates. To
      overcome this drawback, preferred methods of UV laser processing entail
      introducing a light absorptivity enhancement material into the silicone
      rubber to form a flexible support blank that operationally adequately
      absorbs light within a laser ablation wavelength region, and using a UV
      laser beam to cut the apertures. Iron oxide and titanium dioxide are
      preferred dye dopants that function as light absorptivity enhancement
      materials.
DETX  FIG. 14 is a plan view of carrier tape 50 including transparent mask 100.
      Each one of carrier tape 50 and transparent mask 100 has multiple
      apertures formed in them. The apertures formed in mask 100 are second
      apertures (referred to above as apertures 104 and 120), and the apertures
      formed in tape 50 are first apertures (as described in the Background
      Information section). As shown in FIG. 14, some embodiments of first
      apertures 180 of tape 50 have geometries similar to the above-described
      geometries of apertures 104 and 120. Further, the general shapes of first
      apertures 180 may outline the shape of slot-type relief openings
      114.sub.s where such relief openings extend from apertures 104 and 120.
DETX  As shown by the leftmost first aperture 180.sub.1 in tape 50 of FIG. 14,
      an exemplary first aperture 180.sub.1 has a generally rhomboidal shape
      that is similar to, or outlines, the shape of rhomboidal aperture 104 in
      mask 100. In some embodiments, rhomboidal aperture 104 of mask 100 is
      positioned directly above first rhomboidal aperture 180.sub.1. As shown
      in FIG. 14, rhomboidal-shaped first aperture 180.sub.1 lies below and has
      a greater area than that of rhomboidal aperture 104.
DETX  First aperture 180.sub.2 in tape 50 of FIG. 14 has a generally rhomboidal
      shape that includes the outline of two slot-type relief openings
      114.sub.5 that form a portion of second aperture 104 that lies above
      first aperture 180.sub.2. First apertures 60 shown in FIG. 14 are prior
      art rectangular first apertures.
DETX  First aperture 180.sub.3 shown in FIG. 14 has a generally rhomboidal
      shape that includes the outline of four slot-type relief openings
      114.sub.s that extend from each of vertices 105 of second aperture 104
      and that each include a bulbous hole 118.
DETX  First aperture 180.sub.4 of FIG. 14 has a generally rhomboidal shape that
      includes the outline of two slot-type relief openings 114.sub.5 forming a
      portion of second aperture 104 that lies above first aperture 180.sub.4.
DETX  A rightmost first aperture 180.sub.5 is an elliptical-shaped aperture
      whose shape generally outlines the shape of elliptical aperture 120 in
      mask 100. First aperture 180.sub.5 is positioned directly below
      elliptical aperture 120. As shown in FIG. 14, elliptical first aperture
      180.sub.5 has a greater area than that of elliptical aperture 120.
DETX  Skilled persons will recognize that first apertures 180 may have shapes
      other than rhomboidal and elliptical and can include relief opening
      geometries other than those shown in FIG. 14.
DETX  Some embodiments of masks 100 may be acceptable for use in a Model 752B
      Automatic Termination System or a Model 332 High Throughput Discrete
      Termination System, both of which are manufactured by Electro Scientific
      Industries, Inc. of Portland, Oreg. (the assignee of the present
      application).
DETX  As one skilled in the art will appreciate in light of this disclosure,
      certain embodiments are capable of achieving certain advantages over the
      known prior art, including some or all of the following. Miniature
      electronic components can be tightly held in a desired orientation
      without significant mechanical damage (1) to the electrically conductive
      portions of the electronic component and/or (2) to the termination paste
      that is applied to the electronic component during electronic component
      processing. The inclusion of relief openings in the mask extends the life
      of the mask because the relief openings relieve some of the mechanical
      stress on the side margins of the apertures. Also, the relief openings
      enhance the flexibility of the mask and thereby facilitate receipt and
      grip of electronic components having varying geometries and dimensions.
DETX  It will be obvious to those having skill in the art that many changes may
      be made to the details of the above-described embodiments without
      departing from the underlying principles of the invention. The scope of
      the present invention should, therefore, be determined only by the
      following claims.

BSTX CROSS REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATION
BSTX  This application claims priority from Japanese Patent Application No.
      2010-138232 filed on Jun. 10, 2010, the disclosure of which is herein
      incorporated by reference in its entirety.
BSTX BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
BSTX  1. Field of the Invention
BSTX  The present invention relates to a process and a system for assembling an
      electronic circuit by mounting electronic circuit components onto a
      circuit board.
BSTX  2. Discussion of Related Art
BSTX  As disclosed in JP2003-283199A, there is known a technique for providing
      a circuit board with information representing electrical characteristics
      or properties of electronic circuit components that are mounted on the
      circuit board. This publication of the Japanese Patent Application
      discloses an electronic-circuit assembling system including two
      electronic-circuit-component mounters each of which is configured to
      mount a corresponding one of two kinds of electronic circuit components,
      onto the circuit board, so that the mounted electronic circuit components
      constitute an electric circuit formed on the circuit board. In this
      electronic-circuit assembling system, one of the two kinds of electronic
      circuit components are mounted on the circuit board by a corresponding
      one of the two electronic-circuit-component mounters, and then the other
      of the two kinds of electronic circuit components are mounted on the
      circuit board by the other of the two electronic-circuit-component
      mounters. In the above-described one of the two
      electronic-circuit-component mounters (which is configured to carry out
      the mounting operations prior to the mounting operations that are to be
      carried out by the other of the two electronic-circuit-component
      mounters), bar codes indicative of some information are printed onto the
      circuit board. This information indicated by the bar codes is information
      obtained from a database, and specifies ones of the electronic circuit
      components (of the other of the two kinds), which are to be associated
      with ones of the electronic circuit components (of the one of the two
      kinds) mounted by the one of the two electronic-circuit-component
      mounters, for providing the circuit board with a desired performance.
      Thereafter, in the above-described other of the two
      electronic-circuit-component mounters (which is configured to carry out
      the mounting operations after the mounting operations that have been
      carried out by the one of the two electronic-circuit-component mounters),
      the information indicated by the printed barcode is read out by the
      barcode reader, and the above-described ones of the electronic circuit
      components (of the other of the two kinds) specified by the information
      of the bar codes are mounted onto the circuit board, for thereby
      preventing an undesirable association of two electronic circuit
      components which does not guarantee the desired performance of the
      circuit board, namely, preventing such two electronic circuit components
      to be undesirably mounted in association with each other on the circuit
      board.
BSTX SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION
BSTX  On the other hand, there is a need for making it possible to mount
      electronic circuit components, which have been supplied from a component
      supplying device via a component supply position, onto the circuit board
      and to provide the circuit board with information related to electrical
      property values of the mounted components, even where the electrical
      property values of the components and/or the component supply position
      are not predetermined. The present invention was made in the light of the
      background as described above, and an object of the invention is to
      provide an improved electronic-circuit assembling process and an improved
      electronic-circuit assembling system, which satisfy the above need.
BSTX  This object may be achieved by an electronic-circuit assembling process
      which is to be carried out in an electronic-circuit assembling system,
      for assembling an electronic circuit, by mounting a plurality of
      electronic circuit components supplied from at least one component
      supplier of a component supplying device, onto a circuit board supported
      by a board supporting device, wherein the plurality of electronic circuit
      components includes at least one of different-property components having
      respective electrical properties such that the electrical properties of
      at least two of the different-property components are different from each
      other, and wherein the different-property components can be handled as
      being components that are same as each other, in a control for
      controlling mounting of the components onto the circuit board, the
      electronic-circuit assembling process including: (I) a
      different-property-component-related information obtaining step of
      obtaining a different-property-component-related information including
      (a) a property-related information that enables recognition of the
      electrical property of the at least one of the different-property
      components which is supplied from at least one of the at least one
      component supplier and (b) a different-property-component supply position
      that is a position of the at least one of the at least one component
      supplier supplying the at least one of the different-property components,
      such that the different-property-component-related information is
      obtained by detecting at least one of the property-related information
      and the different-property-component supply position; (II) a mounting
      step of mounting, based on at least information related to the
      different-property-component supply position obtained in the
      different-property-component-related information obtaining step, the
      plurality of electronic circuit components including the at least one of
      the different-property components, onto the circuit board; and (III) a
      property-related information providing step of providing the circuit
      board with the property-related information of the at least one of the
      different-property components which is mounted on the circuit board in
      the mounting step.
BSTX  The phrase that "the different-property components can be handled as
      being components that are same as each other, in a control for
      controlling mounting of the components onto the circuit board" may be
      interpreted to mean that, even if there are configurational and/or
      dimensional differences between the components, the degree of the
      difference is within a tolerable range such that the components can be
      handled as being components that are the same as each other, in a case
      where a control is performed to merely control mounting of the component
      onto the circuit board. For example, in the component mounting operation,
      in general, after each component has been supplied from a component
      supplier to a component holder, an image of the component held by the
      component holder is taken by an component-image taking device, for
      carrying out various checks such as (i) judgment as to whether the
      component currently held by the component holder is a correct component
      and (ii) detection of an error of positioning of the component currently
      held by the component holder. The above phrase may be interpreted to mean
      that each of these checks can be carried out for the different-property
      components by using a same reference data common to the
      different-property components, namely, by comparing the detected data
      with the same common reference data, so that the different-property
      components can be handled as if it were the same components in the
      control performed to merely control mounting of the component onto the
      circuit board. It is noted that the phrase "the electrical properties of
      at least two of the different-property components are different from each
      other" may be interpreted to also mean that the electrical properties of
      the different-property components are of a plurality of different levels,
      i.e., are of at least two different levels.
BSTX  In general, an electronic circuit component is expected to exhibit a
      function performance that is inherent to a kind of the electronic circuit
      component, and a degree of the functional performance varies depending on
      the electrical property of each electronic circuit component. There is a
      case where such a variation of the degree of functional performance is
      not ignorable. The electrical property value represents the degree of
      functional performance whose variation could be unignorable.
BSTX  The property-related information may be either the electrical property
      value as such or information that enables recognition of the electrical
      property value.
BSTX  The provision of the property-related information on the circuit board
      may be made in various manners such as printing of the information by a
      printing device, labeling of tape with description of the information, or
      writing of the information into an IC (integrated circuit) chip (e.g.,
      tag chip) having an antenna. The property-related information, which is
      provided by the printing or tape labeling, may be represented by, for
      example, a barcode, two-dimensional code or other code easily readable by
      a device, or characters, numbers, signs, figures or any combination
      thereof
BSTX  All of the plurality of electronic circuit components may be the
      plurality of different-property components, or one or ones of the
      plurality of electronic circuit components may be the at least one of the
      different-property components. In the latter case, the plurality of
      electronic circuit components may include a non-different-property
      component or components such as a chip component (e.g., capacitor chip,
      resistor chip), a lead component (e.g., QFP (quad flat package)) having
      leads and a connector. Where the plurality of different-property
      components are to be mounted onto a single circuit board, the
      different-property components may be mounted together with each other
      onto a predetermined local area within the circuit board or may be
      mounted onto respective positions which are located on an entirety of the
      circuit board and which are distant from each other.
BSTX  The property-related information may be provided either on a
      different-property component mount surface (i.e., a surface of the
      circuit board onto which the at least one of the different-property
      components is to be mounted) or on a surface opposite to the
      different-property component mount surface.
BSTX  Where an electronic circuit is to be manufactured by mounting the
      plurality of electronic circuit components including the at least one of
      the different-property components, onto the circuit board, it is possible
      to increase a degree of freedom in operation carried out in an assembling
      workshop for assembling the electronic circuit, without predetermining at
      least one of the electrical property value and the component supply
      position of the at least one of the different-property components,
      namely, by allowing the at least one of the electrical property value and
      the component supply position to be determined in the assembling
      workshop. The increase of the degree of freedom in the operation in the
      assembling workshop makes it advantageously possible to perform the
      manufacturing of the electronic circuit in a manner satisfying limiting
      conditions that are likely to be required in the assembling workshop.
BSTX  The present electronic-circuit assembling process was developed for the
      above-described advantage. Although the
      "different-property-component-related information obtaining step" may be
      implemented in a manner as described below, this step may be implemented
      in any other manner as long as the property-related information (that
      permits recognition of the electrical property value of the at least one
      of the different-property components) and/or the component supply
      position is obtainable by implementation of the this step. Even where at
      least one of the electrical property value and the component supply
      position is not predetermined and is unknown to the electronic-circuit
      assembling system, it is possible to mount the electronic circuit
      components onto the circuit board and to provide the circuit board with
      the information related to the electrical property value of the
      electronic circuit components (mounted onto the circuit board) in the
      electronic-circuit assembling system, because both of the electrical
      property value and the component supply position can become known to the
      electronic-circuit assembling system through implementation of the
      different-property-component-related information obtaining step, by
      determining the above-described at least one of the electrical property
      value and the component supply position in the assembling workshop and
      causing the determined at least one of the electrical property value and
      the component supply position to be detectable by the electronic-circuit
      assembling system. It is noted that "mounting the electronic circuit
      components onto the circuit board and providing the circuit board with
      the information related to the electrical property value of the mounted
      electronic circuit components" will be simply referred to as "assembling
      the electronic circuit" where appropriate.
BSTX  For example, where the electrical property value of the at least one of
      the different-property components is predetermined so as to be already
      known to the electronic-circuit assembling system while the component
      supply position of the at least one of the different-property components
      is not yet known, it is possible to assemble the electronic circuit, by
      causing both of the electrical property value and the component supply
      position to become known in the electronic-circuit assembling system,
      through two manners, one of which is that the component supply position
      is detected by the electronic-circuit assembling system through an
      automatic detection of an install position in which the component
      supplier storing therein the different-property component (whose
      electrical property value is already known) is installed by an operator
      in the electronic-circuit assembling system, and the other of which is
      that the component supply position is detected by the electronic-circuit
      assembling system through a reception (i.e., detection) of information
      which is related to the install position and which is manually inputted
      by the operator. In the former case, for example, when storing the
      different-property component in the component supplier, the operator may
      input an identification-related information related to identification of
      the component supplier, into the electronic-circuit assembling system, so
      that the install position can be automatically detected by automatically
      determining that the identification-related information of the component
      supplier installed in an install position matches with the manually
      inputted identification-related information of the component supplier.
BSTX  Further, where the component supply position of the at least one of the
      different-property components is predetermined so as to be already known
      to the electronic-circuit assembling system while the electrical property
      value of the at least one of the different-property components is not yet
      known, both of the electrical property value and the component supply
      position can become known in electronic-circuit assembling system,
      because it is possible to detect the electrical property value directly
      or via the identification-related information of the component supplier,
      by manually inputting the electrical property value per se of the
      different-property component into the electronic-circuit assembling
      system by the operator when the different-property component is stored in
      the component supplier by the operator, or by manually inputting a
      correlation between the identification-related information and the
      electrical property value of the component supplier, into the
      electronic-circuit assembling system by the operator when the
      different-property component is stored in the component supplier by the
      operator.
BSTX  Where neither the electrical property value nor the component supply
      position is predetermined so as to be already known to the
      electronic-circuit assembling system, both of the electrical property
      value and the component supply position can be detected, for example, in
      a manner as described below.
BSTX  It is noted that, in the present description, the "obtaining" of the
      property-related information of the different-property component and the
      "obtaining" of the supply position of the different-property component in
      the different-property-component-related information obtaining step or in
      the different-property-component-related information obtaining portion,
      should be interpreted to encompass not only a case where the
      property-related information or the information related to the supply
      position (that has been unknown to the electronic-circuit assembling
      system) is detected automatically in the electronic-circuit assembling
      system but also a case where the property-related information or the

      the at least one of the different-property components which is supplied
      by the component supplying device, based on the
      component-supplier-identification-related information and the component
      supply position of the each of the at least one component supplier

      plurality of electronic circuit components including the at least one of
      the different-property components, from the at least one component

      of the different-property components which has been detected in the

BSTX  The above object may be achieved also by an electronic-circuit assembling
      system for assembling an electronic circuit, by mounting a plurality of
      electronic circuit components onto a circuit board, wherein the plurality
      of electronic circuit components includes at least one of
      different-property components having respective electrical properties
      such that the electrical properties of at least two of the
      different-property components are different from each other, and wherein
      the different-property components can be handled as being components that
      are same as each other, in a control for controlling mounting of the
      components onto the circuit board, the electronic-circuit assembling
      system including: (a) a board supporting device configured to support the
      circuit board; (b) a component supplying device including (b-1) a
      plurality of component suppliers each of which is configured to store
      therein ones of the plurality of electronic circuit components that are
      categorized as one kind of electronic circuit components, and each of
      which is configured to sequentially supply the categorized ones of the
      plurality of electronic circuit components and (b-2) a component-supplier
      holder having a plurality of holding portions holding the component
      suppliers; and (c) an electronic-circuit-component mounter including a
      mounting device configured to receive the plurality of electronic circuit
      components supplied from the component supplying device and to mount the
      electronic circuit components onto the circuit board supported by the
      board supporting device; the electronic-circuit assembling system further
      including: (A) a different-property-component-related information
      obtaining portion configured to automatically detect a
      different-property-component-related information including (i) a
      property-related information that enables recognition of the electrical
      property of at least one of the at least one of the different-property
      components which is stored in at least one of the plurality of component
      suppliers and (ii) a holding-portion position that is a position of one
      of the plurality of holding portions which holds the at least one of the
      plurality of component suppliers, such that the
      different-property-component-related information is obtained by detecting
      at least the property-related information; (B) a mounting controlling
      portion configured, based on information of the holding-portion position
      obtained by the different-property-component-related information
      obtaining portion, to cause the mounting device to receive the plurality
      of electronic circuit components including the at least one of the
      different-property components, from the component supplying device, and
      to cause the mounting device to mount the plurality of electronic circuit
      components onto the circuit board supported by the board supporting
      device; and (C) a property-related information providing portion
      configured to provide the circuit board onto which the at least one of
      the different-property component has been mounted by operation of the
      mounting controlling portion, with the property-related information which
      has been obtained by the different-property-component-related information
      obtaining portion.
BSTX  The above-described "one of the plurality of holding portions" may be
      either a randomly selected one of the plurality of holding portions or a
      predetermined one of the plurality of holding portions. In the former
      case, the different-property-component-related information obtaining
      portion includes a portion configured to automatically detect which one
      of the plurality of holding portions holds the component supplier storing
      therein a different-property component having an randomly selected,
      electrical property value.
BSTX  In the electronic-circuit assembling process according to the present
      invention, even if at least one of the electrical property value and the
      supply position of the different-property component is unknown (unclear),
      the different-property-component-related information is obtained in the
      different-property-component-related information obtaining step, so that
      the different-property component can be mounted onto the circuit board
      and the property-related information can be given to the circuit board.
      Therefore, the operator of the electronic-circuit assembling system can
      cause the system to assemble the electric circuit, by arbitrarily
      determining at least one of the electrical property and the supply
      position of the different-property component, thereby making it possible
      to increase the degree of freedom in operations carried out in an
      assembling workshop for assembling the electronic circuit.
BSTX  For example, where the different-property-component supply position is
      already known (namely, is predetermined and information related to the
      predetermined component supply position is stored in the memory of the
      electronic-circuit assembling system) while the electrical property value
      of the different-property component is unknown, the detection of the
      electrical property value makes it possible to provide the circuit board
      with the property-related information. The electrical property value can
      be utilized, for example, also in preparation of information related to
      record of mounting of the different-property components onto the circuit
      board. Where a plurality of kinds of different-property components that
      are different from each other with respect to the electrical property
      value are supplied from a plurality of component suppliers, it is
      possible to select the kind of different-property components that are to
      be mounted onto the circuit board, on the basis of the electrical
      property value. Where a single kind of different-property components
      whose electrical property value is unknown are supplied from a single
      component supplier, the detection of the electrical property value makes
      it possible to provide the circuit board with the property-related
      information.
BSTX  Further, where the electrical property value of the different-property
      component is already known while the different-property-component supply
      position is unknown, the detection of the component supply position makes
      it possible to take the different-property component from the component
      supplier and to mount the different-property component onto the circuit
      board.
BSTX  Further, where both of the electrical property value and the component
      supply position of the different-property component are unknown, the
      detections of the electrical property value and the
      different-property-component supply position make it possible to obtain
      advantages provided by those detections.
BSTX  In any one of the above cases, the provision of the property-related
      information on the circuit board makes it possible to obtain the
      electrical property value of the different-property component, from the
      circuit board as such. Since the provision of the property-related
      information on the circuit hoard is carried out as a procedure following
      the mounting of the different-property component on the circuit board, it
      is possible to reduce a possibility of mismatching of the electrical
      property value of the different-property component actually mounted on
      the circuit board, with the electrical property value recognized through
      the property-related information. Therefore, it is possible to reduce
      errors in a procedure for determining an electronic circuit component
      (associated component) that is to be associated with the
      different-property component, a procedure for sorting the circuit board
      upon assembling or packing for associating the circuit board with another
      element based on the electrical property value of the mounted
      different-property component, or other procedure carried out for the
      circuit board based on the electrical property value.
BSTX  Further, in the above-described another electronic-circuit assembling
      process according to the present invention, the detection of the
      different-property-component-related information is made based on the
      detections of the component-supplier-identification-related information
      and the component supply position and the memorization of the
      component-supplier/different-property-component correlation-related
      information. Therefore, even if both of the electrical property value and
      the supply position of the supplied different-property component are
      unknown, it is possible to obtain both of them, thereby obtaining
      advantages provided in such as case where both of them are unknown.
BSTX  Further, in the electronic-circuit assembling system according to the
      present invention, even where the electrical property value of the
      different-property component is unknown, the mounting of the
      different-property component onto the circuit board and the provision of
      the property-related information onto the circuit board can be made.

      apparatus which is other than the electronic-circuit-component mounters.
      Were the property-related-information providing device is provided in the
      apparatus other than the component mounters, this apparatus may be either
      an apparatus assigned to perform an operation other than the mounting
      operation or an apparatus (hereinafter referred to as "property-related
      information provider" where appropriate) assigned to perform exclusively
      the operation for providing the circuit board with the
      property-related-information.
BSTX  (4) The electronic-circuit assembling process according to any one of
      modes (1)-(3), including:
BSTX  using, as the electronic-circuit assembling system, a system including an
      electronic-circuit-component mounter having a mounting device that is
      configured to mount the electronic circuit components onto the circuit
      board after taking the electronic circuit components from the component
      supplying device;
BSTX  using, as the component supplying device, a device including (i) a
      plurality of component suppliers as the at least one component supplier
      each of which is configured to store therein the plurality of electronic
      circuit components and to sequentially supply the plurality of electronic
      circuit components to the mounting device and (ii) a component-supplier
      holder having a plurality of holding portions configured to detachably
      hold the plurality of component suppliers;
BSTX  causing at least one of the plurality of component suppliers to store
      therein the at least one of the different-property components;
BSTX  causing at least one of the plurality of holding portions to bold the at
      least one of the plurality of component suppliers storing therein the at
      least one of the different-property components; and
BSTX  causing the electronic-circuit-component mounter to automatically obtain
      (.alpha.) a position of the at least one of the plurality of holding
      portions holding the at least one of the plurality of component suppliers
      and (.beta.) the property-related information of the at least one of the
      different-property components which is supplied from the at least one of
      the plurality of component suppliers.
BSTX  As the component supplier, there are a component feeder (e.g., tape
      feeder, bulk feeder, stick feeder) and a tray having a multiplicity of
      recesses which are formed to lie on a plane and which are configured to
      accommodate therein the components. The electronic circuit components are
      held by a component holding member such as tape, component storage casing
      and stick. The tape is held by a tape holding member such as a reel (on
      which tape is wound) and a tape storage casing (which stores the tape
      therein). The tray serves as the component supplier and also as the
      component holding member. The component supplying device may be
      constituted by the component feeder and/or the tray, so as to supply the
      electronic circuit components.
BSTX  The position of the holding portion (in which the component supplier is
      to be held by the holding portion), i.e., the install position (in which
      the component supplier is to be installed on the component-supplier
      bolder) or the component supply position (in which the different-property
      component is to be supplied from the component-supplier holder) does not
      have to be located in a limited position but may be located in a desired
      position suitable for facilitating the operator to carry out an operation
      for installing the component supplier onto the component-supplier holder.
      Further, where the position of the holding portion (in which the
      component supplier is to be held by the holding portion) has been
      predetermined, even if the component supplier is actually held by the
      holding portion in a position different from the predetermined position,
      it is possible to know the different position in which the holding
      portion actually holds the component supplier, and accordingly to mount
      the different-property component supplied from component supplier, onto
      the circuit board.
BSTX  (5) The electronic-circuit assembling process according to any one of
      modes (1)-(4), including:
BSTX  using, as the electronic-circuit assembling system, a system including a
      mounter line constituted by a plurality of electronic circuit-component
      mounters that are arranged in a line, with each adjacent two of the
      arranged electronic-circuit-component mounters being close to each other
      without a gap which allows the circuit board to be taken out through the
      gap;
BSTX  causing at least one of the arranged electronic-circuit-component
      mounters to mount at least one of the at least one of the
      different-property components onto the circuit board; and
BSTX  causing at least one of the arranged electronic-circuit-component
      mounters to provide the circuit board with the property-related
      information of the at least one of the at least one of the
      different-property components.
BSTX  The property-related information may be provided on the circuit board by
      either the electronic-circuit-component mounter assigned to mount the
      different-property component onto the circuit board, or another
      electronic-circuit-component mounter that is other than the
      electronic-circuit-component mounter assigned to mount the
      different-property component onto the circuit board. In the latter case,
      the mounting of the different-property component and the provision of the
      property-related information are made by respective two of the plurality
      of electronic-circuit-component mounters. In either of the former and
      latter cases, there is no risk that the circuit board would be taken out
      by the operator or another circuit board would be introduced by the
      operator, at a stage between the mounting of the different-property
      component and the provision of the property-related information (i.e.,
      after the mounting of the different-property component before the
      provision of the property-related information, or after the provision of
      the property-related information before the mounting of the
      different-property component), so that the property-related information
      can be reliably given or provided on the circuit board on which the
      different-property component has been mounted or is to be mounted.
BSTX  It is noted that, for establishing a state in which "each adjacent two of
      the arranged electronic-circuit-component mounters being close to each
      other without a gap which allows the circuit board to be taken out
      therethrough", the gap between each adjacent two of the arranged
      electronic-circuit-component mounters may be adapted to be smaller than a
      dimension of the circuit board as measured in a direction in which the
      plurality of electronic-circuit-component mounters are arranged.
      Specifically, this gap may be adapted to be not larger than 200 mm, 100
      mm or 50 mm, for example.
BSTX  (6) The electronic-circuit assembling process according to any one of
      modes (1)-(5), including:
BSTX  using, as the electronic-circuit assembling system, a system including a
      mounter line constituted by a plurality of electronic-circuit-component
      mounters that are arranged in a line, with each adjacent two of the
      arranged electronic-circuit-component mounters being close to each other
      without a gap which allows the circuit board to be taken out through the
      gap;
BSTX  causing at least one of the arranged electronic-circuit-component
      mounters to recognize the property-related information provided in the
      circuit board; and
BSTX  causing at least one of the arranged electronic-circuit-component
      mounters to mount, onto the circuit board, at least one of the electronic
      circuit components, which is determined to be associated with the at
      least one of the at least one of the different-property components, on
      the basis of the recognition of the property-related information.
BSTX  The associated component (i.e., the electronic circuit component, which
      is determined to be associated with the different-property component) may
      be mounted onto the circuit board by either the
      electronic-circuit-component mounter assigned to recognize the
      property-related information, or another electronic-circuit-component
      mounter that is other than the electronic-circuit-component mounter
      assigned to recognize the property-related information. In either of the
      former and latter cases, there is no risk that the circuit board is taken
      out by the operator or another circuit board is introduced by the
      operator, at a stage between the recognition of the property-related
      information and the mounting of the associated component (i.e., after the
      recognition of the property-related information before the mounting of
      the associated component), so that the associated component, which
      suitably corresponds to the recognized property-related information,
      namely, which is to be associated with the different-property component
      whose electrical property is represented by the recognized
      property-related information, can be reliably mounted on the circuit
      board. The different-property component and the associated component may
      be mounted on the same side surface of the circuit board or on respective
      opposite side surfaces of the circuit board.
BSTX  It is noted that, in the electronic-circuit assembling system, there may
      be provided a recognizing device that is to be used exclusively to
      recognize the property-related information, or there may be provided a
      property-related-information recognizer that is constituted by an
      apparatus configured to perform an operation other than the operation for
      mounting the electronic circuit components onto the circuit board. The
      recognizing device may be provided either in the mounter line or outside
      the mounter line. The property-related-information recognizer may be
      configured to recognize not only the property-related information but
      also other information other than the property-related information.
BSTX  (7) The electronic-circuit assembling process according to any one of
      modes (1)-(6), including:
BSTX  using, as the electronic-circuit assembling system, a system including a
      plurality of electronic-circuit-component mounters;
BSTX  causing at least a part of the electronic-circuit-component mounters to
      mount at least one of the at least one of the different-property
      components onto the circuit board;
BSTX  causing at least a part of the electronic-circuit-component mounters to
      provide the circuit board with the property-related information;
BSTX  causing at least a part of the electronic-circuit-component mounters to
      recognize the property-related information provided in the circuit board;
      and
BSTX  causing at least a part of the electronic-circuit-component mounters to
      mount, onto the circuit board, at least one of the electronic circuit
      components, which is determined to be associated with the at least one of
      the at least one of the different-property components, on the basis of
      the recognition of the property-related information.
BSTX  The plurality of electronic-circuit-component mounters may be constituted
      by either mounters cooperating with each other to form a mounter line or
      mounters do not form the mounter line. Further, the mounting of the
      different-property component, provision of the property-related
      information, recognition of the property-related information and mounting
      of the associated component may be made by respective different ones of
      the electronic-circuit-component mounters, or alternatively, at least two
      of the these operations or works may be made by a same one of the
      electronic-circuit-component mounters.
BSTX  (8) The electronic-circuit assembling process according to any one of
      modes (1)-(7), including:
BSTX  using, as the electronic-circuit assembling system, a system including a
      plurality of electronic-circuit-component mounters;
BSTX  causing one of the electronic-circuit-component mounters to mount at
      least one of the at least one of the different-property components onto
      the circuit board;
BSTX  causing the one of the electronic-circuit-component mounters to provide
      the circuit board with the property-related information of the at least
      one of the at least one of the different-property components;
BSTX  causing another one of the electronic-circuit-component mounters to
      recognize the property-related information provided in the circuit board;
      and
BSTX  causing the another one of the electronic-circuit-component mounters to
      mount, onto the circuit board, at least one of the electronic circuit
      components, which is determined to be associated with the at least one of
      the at least one of the different-property components, on the bags of the
      recognition of the property-related information.
BSTX  In the electronic-circuit assembling process according to this mode (8),
      the mounting of the different-property component onto the circuit board
      and the mounting of the associated component onto the circuit board can
      be carried out in parallel with each other or concurrently with each
      other. The provision of the property-related information on the circuit
      board and the recognition of the property-related information provided on
      the circuit board make it possible to mount, onto the circuit board, the
      associated component that is to be associated with the different-property
      component actually mounted on the circuit board. Since the mounting of
      the different-property component and the provision of the
      property-related information are both made by a same one of the
      electronic-circuit-component mounters, while the recognition of the
      property-related information and the mounting of the associated component
      are both made by a same one of the electronic-circuit-component mounters.
      Therefore, there is very little possibility that the circuit board would
      be taken out from the electronic-circuit-component mounter or another
      circuit board would be introduced into the electronic-circuit-component
      mounter at a stage after the mounting of the different-property component
      before the provision of the property-related information and also at a
      stage after the recognition of the property-related information before
      the mounting of the associated component, so that, as a consequence, it
      is possible to remarkably reduce a risk that a wrong component would be
      mounted erroneously as the associated component onto the circuit board.
      Besides, where the above-described one of the
      electronic-circuit-component mounters and the above-described another one
      of the electronic-circuit-component mounters cooperate with each other to
      form a mounter line as recited in the above mode (5) or (6), the risk of
      the erroneous mounting of a wrong component as the associated component
      can be further reduced.
BSTX  (9) The electronic-circuit assembling process according to any one of
      modes (1)-(8), including:
BSTX  using, as the electronic-circuit assembling system, a system including a
      mounter line constituted by a plurality of electronic-circuit-component
      mounters each having a mounting device;
BSTX  causing the mounting device of one of the plurality of
      electronic-circuit-component mounters, to hold, in place of a mounting
      head configured to mount the electronic circuit components on the circuit
      board, a property-related-information providing head configured to
      provide the circuit board with the property-related information; and
BSTX  causing the one of the plurality of electronic-circuit-component mounters
      to provide the circuit board with the property-related information.
BSTX  The above-described one of the electronic-circuit-component mounters in
      which the property-related-information providing head, in place of the
      mounting head, is held by the mounting device may be either an
      intermediate one or a final one (i.e., downstream most one) of the
      mounters in the mounter line. In the former case, the mounting of the
      different-property component is made by a part of the mounters, and the
      provision of the property-related information is made by the
      above-described intermediate one of the mounters which is located on a
      downstream side of a final one among the part of the mounters. The change
      of the mounting head into the property-related-information providing head
      may be made automatically or manually by the operator. The automatic head
      change can be made by, for example, an arrangement, as disclosed in
      JP-2006-261825A, in which the head is selectively clamped and undamped by
      selectively supplying a vacuum pressure to a head holder (holding the
      head) and stopping the supply of the vacuum pressure to the head holder.
BSTX  It might be possible to employ a property-related information providing
      device which does not have a component mounting function and which is to
      be used exclusively to provide the property-related information such that
      the property-related information providing device is disposed in an
      intermediate position or a final position within the mounter line. On the
      other hand, in the process according to this mode (9), the one of the
      electronic-circuit-component mounters can be used also as the
      above-described property-related information provider, thereby making it
      possible to provide the property-related information while avoiding an
      increase of required length of the mounter line and an increase of cost
      required for the system. Thus, saving of the space required for the
      system and saving of the cost required for system can be both realized.
      Further, in a case where the electronic circuit components not including
      any one of the different-property components are to be mounted onto a
      circuit board, or in a case where the different-property component or
      components not requiring provision of the property-related information
      are to be mounted onto a circuit board, the components can be mounted
      onto the circuit board by causing the mounting device to hold the
      mounting head without causing the mounting device to hold the
      property-related-information providing head. Thus, in the process
      according to this mode (9), it is possible to assemble various kinds of
      electronic circuits.
BSTX  (10) The electronic-circuit assembling process according to any one of
      modes (1)-(9), including:
BSTX  using, as the electronic-circuit assembling system, a system including at
      least one electronic-circuit-component mounter each having a plurality of
      mounting devices;
BSTX  causing one of the mounting devices to hold, in place of a mounting head
      configured to mount the electronic circuit components on the circuit
      board, a property-related-information providing head configured to
      provide the circuit board with the property-related information;
BSTX  causing the at least one electronic-circuit-component mounter to mount at
      least one of the at least one of the different-property components onto
      the circuit board; and
BSTX  causing the at least one electronic-circuit-component mounter to provide
      the circuit board with the property-related information.
BSTX  in the electronic-circuit assembling process according to this mode (10),
      the mounting of the different-property component and the provision of the
      property-related information can be both made in the single
      electronic-circuit-component mounter. Until all the operations having
      been scheduled to be carried out in the single
      electronic-circuit-component mounter are completed, the circuit board is
      unlikely to be taken out from the same electronic-circuit-component
      mounter, thereby more satisfactorily assuring matching of the electrical
      property value of the different-property component actually mounted on
      the circuit board, with the electrical property value recognized through
      the property-related information.
BSTX  It is noted that, the method of providing the circuit board with the
      property-related information by causing the mounting device to hold the
      property-related-information providing head in place of the mounting
      head, as described in the above mode (9) or (10), can be employed in a
      case where the circuit board is to be provided with a circuit-board
      identifier that identifies the circuit board. The provision of the
      circuit-board identifier on the circuit board makes it possible to
      identify each circuit board and to utilize the identification of each
      circuit board, for example, in preparation of a record of operations
      carried out for assembling the electronic circuits. The features recited
      in the above mode (9) or (10) may be employed independently of any one of
      the features recited in the above-modes (1)-(8).
BSTX  (11) The electronic-circuit assembling process according to any one of
      modes (1)-(10), wherein the property-related information providing step
      is carried out by causing a printing head to print the property-related
      information onto the circuit board.
BSTX  The printing head may be substantially identical in construction with
      either a printing head of an inkjet printer or a printing head of a
      printing mechanism of a laser printer. As the printing mechanism using a
      laser beam, a laser marker may be employed, for example. As disclosed in
      JP-H11-87805A and JP-H06-143689A, for example, the laser marker is
      constructed to include a laser beam source configured to irradiate the
      laser beam, a focusing lens and a mirror, and is configured to record
      characters or the like on a surface of a print object by applying heat
      onto the surface of the print object.
BSTX  (12) The electronic-circuit assembling process according to any one of
      modes (1)-(11), including:
BSTX  using, as the electronic-circuit assembling system, a system including an
      electronic-circuit-component mounter having a mounting device;
BSTX  installing a plurality of component suppliers on the
      electronic-circuit-component mounter;
BSTX  causing the plurality of component suppliers to supply, as the at least
      one of the different-property components, a plurality of kinds of
      different-property components which are different with respect to level
      of the electrical property, value, such that each one of the kinds of
      different-property components are to be supplied from a corresponding one
      of the component suppliers; and
BSTX  causing the electronic-circuit-component mounter to mount the plurality
      of kinds of different-property components supplied from the component
      suppliers, onto the circuit board supported by the board supporting
      device.
BSTX  Even where the different-property components of a single kind are to be
      mounted on a single circuit board, if the different-property components
      of the single kind becomes zero or insufficient for completing mounting
      of a required number of different-property components of the single kind,
      the different-property components of the same kind may be changed to the
      different-property components of another kind so that the
      different-property components of a plurality kinds are mounted onto the
      single circuit board.
BSTX  By obtaining the different-property-component-related information, the
      level of the electrical property value of the different-property
      component (that is to be supplied) and the supply position of the
      electrical property value can be known, thereby making it possible to
      mount, onto the circuit board, the different-property component having a
      required level of the electrical property value and to replace the kind
      of the different-property component, to be mounted onto the circuit
      board, with another kind of the different-property component.
BSTX  (13) The electronic-circuit assembling process according to mode (12),
      wherein each one of the plurality of kinds of different-property
      components, which are to be mounted onto the circuit board, consist of a
      plurality of different-property components.
BSTX  (14) The electronic-circuit assembling process according to mode (13),
      including:
BSTX  determining a plurality of mount-position groups such that each one of
      determined plurality of mount-position groups is constituted by a
      plurality of mount positions in which the plurality of different-property
      components are to be mounted onto the circuit board; and
BSTX  mounting the different-property components which are the same as each
      other with respect to the electrical property value, onto the respective
      mount positions of each one of the plurality of mount-position groups,
BSTX  wherein the property-related information providing step is implemented by
      providing the circuit board with the property-related information such
      that the provided property-related information is correlated with each
      one of the plurality of mount-position groups.
BSTX  The "different-property components which are the same as each other with
      respect to the electrical property value" may be interpreted to encompass
      "different-property components which are the same as each other with
      respect to a nominal value of the electrical property value and an error
      level (i.e., the different-property components which are the same as each
      other with respect to the nominal value of the electrical property value
      and the level of a difference between the nominal value and an actual
      value of the electrical property value)" and "different-property
      components which are the same as each other with respect to level of the
      electrical property value (i.e., the different-property components having
      the respective electrical property values that belong to the same one of
      a plurality of different levels of the electrical property value).
BSTX  Since the different-property components, which are to be mounted into the
      respective mount positions of each one of the plurality of mount-position
      groups, are the same as each other with respect to the electrical
      property, the property-related information does not have to be provided
      in correlation with each one of the different-property components mounted
      in the respective mount positions of each one of the mount-position
      groups, as long as the property-related information is provided in
      correlation with each one of the plurality of mount-position groups.
BSTX  (15) The electronic-circuit assembling process according to any one of
      modes (1)-(14), including:
BSTX  mounting a plurality of light emitting diodes as the at least one of the
      different-property components, onto the circuit board;
BSTX  providing the circuit board with, as the property-related information, a
      brightness-level-related information that enables recognition of a
      brightness level as the electrical property value of the light emitting
      diodes; and
BSTX  mounting, onto the circuit board, at least one resistor as at least one
      of the electronic circuit components, which has a resistance value
      determined based on the bright level, and which is determined to be
      associated with the light emitting diodes, on the basis of the
      recognition of the bright level.
BSTX  In recent years, there is a need for a technique for mounting a
      multiplicity of electronic circuit components that are identical with one
      another or the same as each other, onto a single circuit board. As an
      example of such a technique, there is known a technique for mounting a
      multiplicity of light emitting diodes (hereinafter simply referred to as
      "LEDs") onto a single circuit board, for thereby manufacturing light
      sources such as a television display, a computer display, a backlight for
      a vehicle's instrument panel indicator, vehicle's backlight and
      frontlight and a general purpose luminaire.
BSTX  LED has many advantages such as high energy efficiency, long service life
      and low cost. However, in today's manufacturing technology, it is still
      difficult to manufacture LED such that the manufactured LED is provided
      with a highly accurate and constant brightness. The backlight or the like
      is required to have brightness that is uniform over an entirety of its
      light emitting surface. The LED is sensibly influenced by factors such as
      change of environment (e.g., temperature and humidity) in process of
      manufacture of the LED. For example, its property, particularly, its
      brightness exhibited upon supply of a rated current to the LED is likely
      to be variable depending on variation of the manufacture environment.
      That is the LED corresponds to a property-variable component which has an
      electrical property value that is variable at a plurality of levels and
      which could be, for example, handled as if being a property-non-variable
      component (i.e., electronic circuit component whose electrical property
      is not variable at a plurality of levels) in a case where a control is
      performed to merely control mounting of the component onto the circuit
      board. In other words, the LEDs correspond to the above-described
      different-property components which have respective electrical properties
      such that the electrical properties of at least two of the
      different-property components are different from each other, and which
      can be handled as if being components that are same as each other, in a
      control for controlling mounting of the components onto the circuit
      board. In view of this, the LEDs are sorted into a plurality of groups of
      respective different brightness levels, and the LEDs sorted into the same
      group and having the same brightness levels are mounted onto a single
      circuit board or onto each one of a plurality of areas within the single
      circuit board, so that it is considered that the brightness could be made
      uniform over n entirety of the light emitting surface, by controlling an
      electric current (that is supplied to each of the LEDs) by at least one
      resistor. In the electronic-circuit assembling process according to this
      mode (15), owing to the provision of the brightness-level-related
      information onto the circuit board together with the mounting of the LEDs
      onto the circuit board, it is possible to mount, onto the circuit board,
      the at least one resistor suitable for the brightness of the LEDs that
      have been actually mounted onto the circuit board. For example, even in a
      case where the LED actually mounted on the circuit board has a brightness
      level that mismatches with a predetermined brightness level for some
      reason, the property-related information that is provided after the
      mounting of the LEDs onto the circuit board makes it possible to reliably
      mount, onto the circuit board, the at least one resistor which is
      suitable for the brightness of the LEDs having been actually mounted onto
      the circuit board, namely, which is to be associated with the actually
      mounted LEDs.
BSTX  Where the plurality of LEDs are mounted onto the circuit board, the at
      least one resistor as the associated component may be mounted so as to be
      associated with each one of the LEDs, or mounted commonly for two or more
      of the LEDs so as to be associated with the two or more of the LEDs. The
      LEDs, each of which are to be associated by the at least one resistor,
      may correspond to either all the LEDs mounted on the circuit board or a
      part of the LEDs mounted on the circuit board. Similarly, the LEDs, whose
      brightness level is represented by the brightness-level-related
      information, may correspond to either all the LEDs mounted on the circuit
      board or a part of the LEDs mounted on the circuit board.
BSTX  It is noted that the brightness-level-related information may include not
      only the brightness level as such but also another information having
      one-to-one correspondence with the brightness level.
BSTX  (20) An electronic-circuit assembling system for assembling an electronic
      circuit, by supplying a plurality of electronic circuit components from
      at least one component supplier of a component supplying device, and
      mounting the plurality of electronic circuit components onto a circuit
      board, wherein the plurality of electronic circuit components includes at
      least one of different-property components having respective electrical
      properties such that the electrical properties of at least two of the
      different-property components are different from each other, and wherein
      the different-property components can be handled as being components that
      are same as each other, in a control for controlling mounting of the
      components onto the circuit board,

      components which is supplied from at least one of the at least one
      component supplier and (ii) a different-property-component supply
      position that is a position of the at least one of the at least one
      component supplier supplying the at least one of the different-property
      components,

      onto the circuit board; and
BSTX  a property-related information providing portion configured to provide
      the circuit board with the property-related information which has been

      electronic-circuit-component mounter having the
      different-property-component-related information obtaining portion or may
      be provided apart from the electronic-circuit-component mounter having
      the information obtaining portion.

DETX DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS
DETX  There will be described embodiments of the claimable invention, by
      reference to the accompanying drawings. It is to be understood that the
      claimable invention is not limited to the embodiments, and may be
      otherwise embodied with various changes and modifications, such as those
      described in the foregoing "VARIOUS MODES OF THE INVENTION", which may
      occur to those skilled in the art.
DETX  FIG. 1 shows an electronic-circuit assembling system (hereinafter simply
      referred to as "assembling system") that is to be used for carrying out
      an electronic-circuit assembling process. This assembling system includes
      a substrate ID reading unit 1, a solder printer 3, another substrate ID
      reading unit 4, a mounter line 5 and a reflow furnace 6 that are arranged
      in a single line in this order of description, such that the substrate ID
      reading unit 1 is located in an upstream end position while the reflow
      furnace 6 is located in a downstream end position. Each of the substrate
      ID reading units 1, 4 is configured to read a circuit-board identifier
      (hereinafter simply referred to "substrate ID") that is given or provided
      on a circuit board. The substrate ID may be represented by a barcode, for
      example. Each of the substrate ID reading units 1, 4 may be constituted
      by a barcode reader, for example. The solder printer 3 includes a
      controller that is constituted principally by a computer, and is
      configured to print a cream solder onto the circuit board, so that the
      printed cream solder serves to temporarily attach electronic circuit
      components onto the circuit board. The solder printer 3 may be
      constituted by a screen printer, for example. The mounter line 5 is
      constituted by a plurality of mounting modules 10 fixed to a plurality of
      bases 12 that are arranged side-by-side. Each adjacent four of the
      mounting modules 10 are arranged side-by-side, and are fixed to a
      corresponding one of the bases 12 which is common to the adjacent four
      mounting modules 10. The mounting modules 10 may be referred also to as
      electronic-circuit-component mounters, and are configured to mount the
      electronic circuit components onto the circuit board. The mounting
      modules 10 are assigned to perform respective assigned works in
      operations for mounting the electronic circuit components onto the
      circuit board, in parallel with each other, so that it is possible to
      reduce a cycle time required to mount the electronic circuit components
      onto the circuit board, as compared with a case in which the mounting
      operations are carried out by a single electronic-circuit-component
      mounter. The reflow furnace 6 is provided to fuse the cream solder by
      heating the cream solder and then to solder the electronic circuit
      components onto a printed circuit of the circuit board. The substrate ID
      reading units 1, 4, solder printer 3, mounting modules 10 and reflow
      furnace 6 will be hereinafter referred to as "component apparatuses" of
      the assembling system, which are generic terms of the ID reading units 1,
      4, solder printer 3, mounting modules 10 and reflow furnace 6.
DETX  Each of the mounting modules 10 has a construction which is described in
      detail, for example, in JP-2004-104075A, so that its parts not related to
      the claimable invention will not be described in detail.
DETX  As shown in FIG. 2, each of the mounting modules 10 includes a module
      main body 18 as a main body frame, a circuit-board conveying device 20, a
      circuit-board holding device 22, a fiducial-mark-image taking device 28
      (see FIG. 4), a component-image taking device 30 and an electric
      controlling device 32.
DETX  As shown in FIG. 2, the module main body 18 includes: a bed 36 that is
      elongated in a front-rear direction (i.e., Y-axis direction) of the
      mounting module 10; two front columns 38 that extend upwardly from a
      front end portion of the bed 36; two rear columns 40 that extend upwardly
      from a rear end portion of the bed 36; and a crown 42 that is supported
      by the four columns 88, 40. The crown 42 is constituted by a beam 44 as a
      reinforcing member and a cover 46 covering an upper side surface of the
      beam 44.
DETX  As shown in FIG. 2, the circuit-board conveying device 20 includes two
      circuit-board conveyors 54, 56, and is configured to convey each circuit
      board 57 (positioned in a central portion of the bed 86 in the front-rear
      direction of the mounting module 10), in a horizontal direction that is
      parallel to a direction in which the plurality of mounting modules 10 are
      arranged. The conveyance of each circuit board 57 is performed by at
      least one of the circuit-board conveyors 54, 56. The mounting modules 10,
      which cooperate with one another to form the mounter line 5, are arranged
      with each adjacent two of the arranged mounting modules 10 being close to
      each other without a gap which allows the circuit board 58 to be taken
      out through the gap. The transfer of the circuit board 57 between each
      adjacent two of the arranged mounting modules 10 is performed directly by
      cooperation of one of the circuit-board conveyors 54, 56 of one of the
      adjacent two mounting modules 10 and a corresponding to the circuit-board
      conveyors 54, 56 of the other of the adjacent two mounting modules 10.
      The gap between each adjacent two of the mounting modules 10 is adapted
      to be smaller than a dimension of a smallest kind of circuit boards 57 as
      measured in a circuit-board conveyance direction (in which the circuit
      boards 57 are to be conveyed), wherein the dimension of the smallest kind
      of circuit boards 57 is the smallest among those of all the kinds of
      circuit boards 57 onto which the electronic circuit components are to be
      mounted. In the present embodiment, this gap is 80 mm. Each of
      upstream-most one and downstream-most one of the plurality of mounting
      modules 10 forming the mounter line 5 is provided with an openable and
      closable cover, for opening and closing an opening (that is not what is
      provided for allowing loading/unloading of the circuit board) which is
      located on a side remote from another one of the mounting modules 10 that
      is adjacent to the upstream-most one or downstream-most one of the
      mounting modules 10. With this openable and closable cover being closed,
      an operator is not allowed to introduce his hand into the mounting module
      10.
DETX  The circuit-board holding device 22 is provided in each of the two
      circuit-board conveyors 54, 56, and includes a board supporting device 48
      and clamping members (not shown), such that the circuit board 57 takes a
      posture that causes its mount surface (onto which the electronic circuit
      components are to be mounted) to be held in parallel to a horizontal
      plane while the circuit board 57 is being held by the board supporting
      device 48. The board supporting device 48 includes: a plurality of
      supporting members (not shown) that are to support the circuit board 57
      from the lower side; and a supporting base 50 supporting the supporting
      members. Each of the circuit-board conveyors 54, 56 is provided in a pair
      of side frames, and the clamping members are provided on the pair of side
      frames. The clamping members cooperate with pressing portions of the
      respective side frames, so as to grip opposite end portions of the
      circuit board 57 (which are parallel to the circuit-board conveyance
      direction) from the upper and lower sides of the board 57. In the
      following descriptions regarding the present embodiment, the
      circuit-board conveyance direction is referred to as X-axis direction
      while a direction orthogonal to the X-axis direction (on a horizontal
      plane, i.e., a plane parallel to the mount surface of the circuit board
      57 held by the circuit-board holding device 22) is referred to as Y-axis
      direction.
DETX  As shown in FIG. 2, the component supplying device 24 is provided on a
      front side of the mounting module 10, i.e., on one of opposite sides, in
      the Y-axis direction, of the bed 36, which is remote from the
      circuit-board conveying device 20. The component supplying device 24 is
      configured to supply the electronic circuit components, for example, by
      means of tape feeders (hereinafter simply referred to as "feeders") 58.
      The component supplying device 24 includes, in addition to the plurality
      of feeders 58, a feeder holding base 160 (see FIG. 3) (hereinafter simply
      referred to as "holding base 150") serving as a component-supplier holder
      in the form of a feeder holder that holds the feeders 58. Each of the
      feeders 58 includes a feeding device 59 (see FIG. 8) that is configured
      to intermittently feed a component holding tape holding the multiplicity
      of electronic circuit components that are identical with one another,
      such that the component holding tap is fed by a constant distance (that
      corresponds to a pitch between each adjacent two of the electronic
      circuit components held by the component holding tap) in each one of the
      successive feed motions.
DETX  In the present embodiment, the holding base 150 is fixed onto the bed 36,
      and has a plurality of slots 152 (e.g., T slots) which extend in the
      Y-axis direction and which are equally spaced apart from each other in
      the X-axis direction, a shown in FIG. 3. The holding base 150 includes a
      vertically extending wall portion 154 that extends upwardly from a rear
      end portion (i.e., one of opposite end portions which is located on the
      side of the circuit-board conveying device 20) of the holding base 150.
      The vertically extending wall portion 154 has positioning holes and
      connectors (not shown) such that each pair of the positioning holes and
      each of the connectors are provided in a portion of the wall portion 154
      which corresponds to a corresponding one of the slots 152. Each of the
      slots 152 cooperates with the corresponding portion in which the
      corresponding pair of positioning holes and the corresponding connector
      are provided, to constitute a holding portion 156. Thus, the holding base
      150 has the plurality of holding portions 156.
DETX  Each of the feeders 58 is fitted, at a rail (not shown) provided on its
      lower surface, in a corresponding one of the slots 158. Each feeder 58 is
      positioned, in a predetermined position relative to the holding base 150,
      with a pair of positioning protrusions provided on a front surface of the
      feeder 58, being fitted in the above-described pair of positioning holes.
      Further, by manually operating an engaging device (not shown) by the
      operator, the plurality of feeders 58 as component suppliers are
      detachably fixed onto the holding base 150 such that the fixed feeders 58
      are arranged in the X-axis direction. The plurality of holding portions
      156 of the holding base 150 are located in respective holding-portion
      positions which define install positions in which the feeders 58 is
      installed to be held by the respective holding portions 156. Each of the
      install positions serves also as a component supply position in which the
      electronic circuit components are to be supplied from the corresponding
      feeder 58 held by the corresponding holding portion 156. The
      above-described connector of each of the holding portions 156 has a
      communicating portion 112 (see FIG. 8) and an electric power supplying
      portion (not shown), while a connector provided on the above-described
      front surface of each of the feeders 58 has a communicating portion 114
      (see FIG. 8) and an electric-power receiving portion (not shown).
      Therefore, when each feeder 58 is installed on the corresponding holding
      portions 156, the connectors are connected to each other, so that the
      communicating portions 112, 114 become communicable with each other while
      an electric power can be supplied to the power receiving portion via the
      power supplying portion.
DETX  As shown in FIGS. 2 and 4, the mounting device 26 has a mounting head 60
      (60a, 60b) and a head moving device 62 configured to move the mounting
      head 60 (60a, 60b). As shown in FIG. 4, the head moving device 62 has a
      X-axis direction moving device 64 and a Y-axis direction moving device
      66. The Y-axis direction moving device 66 has a linear motor 70 which is
      provided in the crown 42 of the module main body 18 and which extends so
      as to bridge over a component supplying portion of the component
      supplying device 24 and the two circuit-board holding devices 22, so that
      a Y-axis slide 72 as a movable unit is movable to be positioned in a
      desired position by operation of the linear motor 70. In the present
      embodiment, the X-axis direction Moving device 64 is disposed on the
      Y-axis elide 72, and has first and second X-axis slides 74, 76 and two
      X-axis slide moving devices 78. The first and second X-axis slides 74, 76
      are movable relative to the Y-axis slide 72 in the X-axis direction, and
      each of the X-axle slides 74, 76 is movable relative to the other of the
      X-axis slides 74, 76 in the X-axis direction. The two X-axis slide moving
      devices 78 are configured to moved the respective first and second X-axis
      slides 74, 76 in the X-axis direction. (In FIG. 4, only one of the two
      X-axis slide moving devices 78 which is configured to move the second
      X-axis slide 76 is shown.) Each of the two X-axis slide moving devices 78
      includes, for example, a drive source in the form of an electric rotary
      motor (e.g., servo motor with rotary encoder) and a feed screw mechanism
      constituted by a ball screw and a nut, and is configured to move a
      corresponding one of the X-axis slides 74, 76 to a desired position. In
      the present embodiment, the drive source of each of the two X-axis slide
      moving devices 78 is constituted by the electric rotary motor in the form
      of a servo motor whose angular position is accurately controllable.
DETX  The mounting head 60 is detachably attached to the second X-axis slide
      76, and is to be moved, by the head moving device 62, to be positioned in
      a desired position within a movement area, i.e., a mounting operation
      area that bridges over the component supplying portions of the component
      suppliers 24 and the two circuit-board holding device 22. The mounting
      head 60 is detachably attached to the second X-axis slide 76 by means of
      an attachment mechanism that has substantially the same construction as
      an attachment mechanism, for example, which is disclosed in
      JP-2004-221518A, so that the attachment mechanism will not be described
      and shown in the drawings. The mounting head 60 configured to hold the
      electronic circuit components through suction nozzles 86 (86a, 86b) as a
      kind of component holders. In the present embodiment, there are available
      various kinds of mounting heads 60 which are different from each other
      with respect to the number of nozzle holders as examples of
      component-holder holding portions each holding the suction nozzle 86, so
      that a selected one of the mounting heads 60, which is selected depending
      on kind of the circuit board 57 (onto which the electronic circuit
      components are to be mounted), is attached to the second X-axle slide 76.
DETX  For example, a mounting head 60a as shown in FIG. 5A has a single nozzle
      holder 88a that holds one suction nozzle 86a, while a mounting head 60b
      as shown in FIG. 5B has a total of twelve nozzle holders 88b, so as to be
      capable of holding twelve suction nozzles 86b as a maximum number of
      suction nozzles 86b. The number of the nozzle holders 88b does not
      necessarily have to be twelve but may be any number not smaller than two,
      preferably, not smaller than three. Each of the suction nozzles 86
      includes a suction tube 90 and a background defining plate 92. In the
      present embodiment, there are available various kinds of suction nozzles
      86 which are different in at least one of a diameter of the suction tube
      90 (as measured at its suction surface) and a diameter of the background
      defining plate 92 (that has a circular shape in its, plan view), so that
      one of the suction nozzles 86 is selected depending on the electronic
      circuit components (that are to be sucked) so as to be used. The suction
      surface and the background defining plate 92a of the suction nozzle 86a
      have respective diameters larger than those of the suction surface and
      the background defining plate 92b of the suction nozzle 88b. The suction
      nozzle 86a is used to mount large-sized electronic circuit components.
DETX  In the mounting head 60a, the nozzle holder 88a is vertically movable and
      rotatable by a movement device (not shown) that is provided in a main
      body of the mounting head 60a. The movement device serves as an elevating
      device and a rotating device, and is axially or vertically movable and
      rotatable about its axis relative to the main body of the mounting head
      60a. As shown in FIG. 6, the mounting head 60b is a rotary-type mounting
      head having has a main body 96, a rotary body 100 which is attached to
      the main body 96 and which is rotatable about a vertical axis, and a
      rotating device 102 configured to rotate the rotary body 100 in forward
      or reverse direction by a desired degree of angle. The twelve nozzle
      holders 88b are disposed on respective portions of the rotary body 100
      that are located in respective twelve positions which lie on a circle
      (whose center corresponds to the above-described vertical axial) and
      which are circumferentially spaced apart from each other by a suitable
      interval. In the present embodiment, the twelve positions are
      equi-angularly spaced apart from each other in a circumferential
      direction. Each of the twelve nozzle holders 88b is rotatable about its
      axis, and is movable in parallel to the above-described vertical axis
      relative to the rotary body 100. Each of the suction nozzles 86b is
      detachably held by a distal end portion of a corresponding one of the
      nozzle holders 88b, namely, by a lower end portion of the corresponding
      nozzle holder 88b in a state in which the mounting head 60b is attached
      to the second X-axis slide 76.
DETX  The twelve nozzle holders 88b (each of which is rotatable about its axis,
      as described above) are rotated about the above-described vertical axis
      by rotation of the rotary body 100 about the vertical axis, so as to be
      sequentially positioned in a component suction position (i.e., a
      component picking position) that corresponds to a predetermined one of
      twelve stop positions. When each of the nozzle holders 88b is positioned
      in the component suction position, the nozzle holder 88b is vertically
      moved by a movement device in the form of an elevating device 104
      disposed in a portion of the main body 96 of the mounting head 60b, which
      portion positionally corresponds to the component suction position.
      Further, the nozzle holder 88b is rotated about its axis by a holder
      rotating device 106 that is provided in the main body 96. As shown in
      FIG. 3, the fiducial-mark-image taking device 28 is mounted on the second
      X-axis slide 76, and is movable together with the mounting head 60 by the
      head moving device 62.
DETX  To the second X-axis elide 76, as shown in FIG. 7, a printing head 170 as
      a property-related-information providing head can be attached in place of
      the mounting head 60. In the present embodiment, like a printing head of
      an inkjet printer, the printing head 170 is configured to eject ink
      droplets onto a recording object so as to print characters, numbers,
      signs, figures or the like on the recording object. To this end, the
      printing head 170 includes a printer 172 vertically movably disposed on a
      head main body (not shown) and a printer elevating device (not shown)
      configured to vertically move the printer 172. The printer 172 includes
      an ink tank 174, an ink ejecting portion 176 and an actuator mechanism
      178 that is configured to eject ink droplets formed of ink stored in the
      ink tank 174, through nozzles provided in the ink ejecting portion 176,
      for example, by deformation of piezoelectric elements. The nozzles having
      respective ejection openings are arranged in a single nozzle row or a
      plurality of nozzle rows. When the printing head 170 is being attached to
      the second X-axis slide 76, the nozzle row or rows are parallel to the
      Y-axis direction while the ejection openings of the respective nozzles
      face downwardly.
DETX  The printing head 170 is provided with a barcode reader 180 as an
      information reading device that is a kind of an information recognizing
      device, and serves also as an information reading head as an information
      recognizing head. When the printing head 170 is being attached to the
      second X-axis slide 76, a reading portion 182 of the barcode reader 180
      faces downwardly and is elongated in the X-axis direction. Further, with
      the printing head 170 being attached to the second X-axis slide 76, the
      reading portion 182 is positionable in a height position that permits the
      reading portion 182 to read the barcode printed on the circuit board 57
      without interfering with any other components of the mounting module 10.
      The printing head 170 is detachably attached to the second X-axis slide
      76 through an attachment mechanism having the same construction as the
      above-described attachment mechanism through which the mounting head 60
      is attached to the second X-axis slide 76. The mounting module 10 in
      which the printing head 170 is attached serves as a printing module 10 as
      a printer that is a kind of property-related information provider, and
      serves also as an information reading module 10 as an information reader
      that is kind of a property related information recognizer.
DETX  Each mounting module 10 is provided with a module controller 108 as a
      part of the above-described electric controlling device 32. As shown in
      FIG. 8, the module controller 108 is configured to control the
      circuit-board conveying device 20, circuit-board holding device 22,
      mounting device 26, fiducial-mark-image taking device 28 and
      component-image taking device 30. Meanwhile, each feeder 58 is provided
      with a feeder controller 110 that is configured to control the feeding
      device 59, as shown in FIG. 8. The module controller 108 and the feeder
      controller 110 are constituted principally by respective computers, and
      are held in communication with each other via the above-described
      communicating portion 112 provided in the holding portion 156 of the
      holding base 150 and the above-described communicating portion 114
      provided in the feeder 58, so that various informations can be supplied
      from one of the two controllers 108, 110 to the other of the two
      controllers 108, 110. Where the printing head 170 is being attached to
      the second X-axis slide 76, the printing head 170 is controlled by the
      module controller 108 to print and read the barcode.
DETX  In the present embodiment, a backlight for personal computer display is
      assembled by mounting a multiplicity of light emitting diodes
      (hereinafter referred to as "LEDs") 122 as a kind of different-property
      components onto a multi-piece substrate 120 as shown in FIG. 9, by
      operations of the assembling system constructed as described above. The
      multi-piece substrate 120 is constituted by a total of M pieces of
      elongated substrate pieces 124 that are connected to one another via a
      frame portion 126. Onto a surface of each substrate piece 124, a total of
      N pieces of LEDs 122 having the same brightness level are to be mounted
      to be arranged in a single row. That is, on an entirety of the
      multi-piece substrate 120, the LEDs 122 are arranged in M rows and N
      lines at a constant pitch in both of the row and line directions, such
      that the LEDs 122 arranged in each of the M rows are required to have the
      same brightness level. After the LEDs 122 have been mounted onto the
      multi-piece substrate 120, the multi-piece substrate 120 are divided into
      M pieces of LED bars by cutting off the frame portion 126. The brightness
      level of the LEDs 122 in any one of the LED bars have to be constant or
      uniform over an entirety of the LED bar, although the brightness level of
      the LEDs 122 in any one of the LED bars may be different from that of the
      LEDs 122 in the others of the LED bars.
DETX  The brightness of the LED 122 upon supply of a rated current thereto is
      inevitably variable depending on a condition of environment (e.g.,
      temperature and humidity) at which the LED 122 is manufactured. In view
      of this, after having been manufactured, the LEDs 122 are sorted into a
      plurality of groups of respective different brightness levels (e.g., 100
      levels), so that the LEDs 122 sorted into the same group and having the
      same brightness level are stored in a single carrier tape. The carrier
      tape storing the LEDs 122 of the same brightness level is wound on a
      single reel 140 (see FIG. 2), and is a product that is to be distributed
      to a market. In the present embodiment, the reel 140 is provided with a
      barcode 142 representing information including the type and brightness
      level of the LEDs 122 stored in the carrier tape that is wound on the
      same reel 140. Further, in the present embodiment, the information
      represented by the barcode 142 includes also a reel identifier in the
      form of a reel ID of the reel 140 and a number of the LEDs 122 stored in
      the carrier tape as a new carrier tape. The feeder 58 is provided with a
      barcode 144 representing information including at least a feeder
      identifier in the form of a feeder ID of the feeder 58. The reel ID
      corresponds to a component-holding-member-identification-related
      information, while the feeder ID corresponds to a
      component-supplier-identification-relate information.
DETX  As described above, all the LEDs as the electronic circuit components
      mounted onto the multi-piece substrate 120 are the same in kind and type
      but are different in brightness level at a plurality of levels. Since the
      brightness of the backlight has to be constant or uniform over its entire
      surface, the LEDs 122 of the same brightness level are mounted onto each
      of the substrate pieces 124, and the electric currents supplied to the
      LEDs 122 are controlled through resistors, so that the brightness values
      of the LEDs 122 constituting the entirety of the backlight can be equal
      to one another. In general, a backlight manufacturer is required to
      manufacture a backlight by using the LEDs 122 which are available to the
      manufacturer and which are likely to be different in the brightness value
      at a plurality of different levels. There will be described a case with
      conditions that (1) the number of the available LEDs 122 is larger than a
      number of LEDs 122 required for a certain number of the backlights that
      are projected to be manufactured, (2) the available LEDs 122 are
      different in the brightness level at a plurality of different levels, (3)
      the available LEDs 122 are sorted into a plurality of groups depending on
      the brightness level, and the LEDs 122 having the same brightness level
      and sorted into the same group are stored together with one another, and
      (4) the number of the LEDs 122 of each group is known.
DETX  In the present embodiment, as shown in FIG. 9, the LEDs 122 are mounted
      onto the surface of each of the M pieces of substrate pieces 124 of the
      multi-piece substrates 120, and at least one resistor 190 (see FIG. 10)
      as at least one associated component, which is to be associated with the
      mounted LEDs 122, is also mounted on the surface of the substrate piece
      124. In addition, a barcode representing information related to the
      substrate piece 124 is printed on the surface of the substrate piece 124.
      In the present embodiment, the LEDs 122 are mounted in an area within
      each of the substrate pieces 124, wherein this area corresponds to a LED
      mount area 192 as a predetermined different-property-component mount area
      onto which the different-property components having the same electrical
      property value are to be mounted. Thus, the number of the LED mount areas
      192 provided on the multi-piece substrate 120 as a single circuit board
      is M. In the present embodiment, the surface of each substrate piece 124
      is sectioned into the LED mount area 192, a resistor mount area 194 and a
      barcode print area 196 which are constituted by respective portions of
      the surface of the substrate piece 124. The resistor mount area 194
      serves as an associated-component mount area in which the resistor or
      resistors 190 are to be mounted. The barcode print area 196 serves as a
      barcode provision area as a kind of an information record area or a
      property-related information provision area. The information related to
      each substrate piece 124 includes at least the brightness level of the
      LEDs 122 mounted onto the same substrate piece 124. In the present
      embodiment, the brightness level corresponds to the electrical property
      value, and the brightness level as such serves as a property-related
      information by which the electrical property value or level of the LEDs
      122 are recognizable. The barcode printed in the barcode print area 196
      represents particular informations, so that the substrate piece 124 is
      provided with the brightness level of the LEDs 122, by printing of the
      barcode in the barcode print area 196. It is noted that the
      property-related information may be include, in addition to the
      information related to the brightness level, information representing an
      identification number of the substrate piece 124, for example.
DETX  In the resistor mount area 194 of each of the M pieces of substrate
      pieces 124, there is formed a resistor circuit 200 (in which the
      resistors 190 are to be provided), as partially shown in (a2) of FIG.
      10A. The resistor circuit 200 has a plurality of connection terminals 202
      which are arranged such that the provided resistors 190 can be connected
      in series and/or parallel with one another.
DETX  The resistors 190 consist of a plurality of kinds of resistors that
      different from one another in resistance value at a plurality of levels.
      Therefore, similarly with the LEDs 122, the resistors 190 are sorted into
      a plurality of groups of respective different resistant values, so that
      the resistors 190 sorted into the same group and having the same
      resistance value are stored in a single carrier tape. The carrier tape
      storing the resistors 190 of the same resistance value is wound on the
      single reel 140. Each reel 140 is provided with the barcode 142
      representing information including the type and resistance value of the
      resistors 190 stored in the carrier tape that is wound on the same reel
      140. Further, in the present embodiment, the information represented by
      the barcode 142 includes also a reel identifier in the form of a reel ID
      of the reel 140. The resistance value corresponds to the electrical
      property value of the associated component, and serves as the
      property-related information by which the electrical property value of
      the resistors 190 are recognizable.
DETX  In the present embodiment, the printing of the barcode and the mounting
      of the resistors 190 onto the substrate piece 124 are carried out,
      following the mounting of the LEDs 122 onto the substrate piece 124, in
      the mounter liner 5. To this end, in the present embodiment, among a
      plurality of mounting modules 10 (e.g., eight mounting modules 10)
      constituting the mounter line 5, the downstream-most mounting module 10
      is assigned to mount the mount the resistors 190 onto the substrate piece
      124, the mounting module 10 adjacent to the downstream-most mounting
      module 10 is assigned to serve as the printing module 10, and the other
      six mounting modules 10 are all, assigned to mount the LEDs 122 onto the
      substrate piece 124.
DETX  In a stage in which the LEDs 122 are mounted onto each substrate piece
      124 of the multi-piece substrate 120, it may be considered that the
      multi-piece substrate 120 is an ordinary substrate rather than a
      multi-piece substrate and that the LEDs 122 of M rows and N lines are
      mounted onto the substrate. However, in this stage, there is a
      requirement that the LEDs 122 arranged in each of the M rows have to be
      the same to each other with respect to the brightness level. Further, in
      order to enable the mounting work, which are shared by the plurality of
      mounting modules 10, to be carried out in a minimum cycle time with
      maximum throughputs, it is desirable that the mounting modules 10 are
      assigned to work for the same number of rows, and that, if the number M
      of the rows is a number indivisible by the number of the mounting modules
      10, one of the mounting modules 10 is assigned to work for a smaller
      number of rows, which is smaller than a number of rows assigned by each
      of the other mounting modules 10.
DETX  Where there are a large number of LEDs 122 having the same brightness
      level, it is desirable that the LEDs 122 of the same brightness level are
      mounted by the same mounting module 10 as many as possible, in order to
      reduce the number of change of the brightness level, as described below.
      Further, it is desirable that, if all the LEDs 122 having the same
      brightness level cannot be mounted by the same mounting module 10, the
      LEDs 122 are mounted by the mounting modules 10 adjacent to each other.
      Moreover, in such a case, it is desirable that some of the LEDs 122 are
      mounted by an upstream one of the adjacent mounting modules 10 and then
      the other LEDs 122 are mounted by a downstream one of the adjacent
      mounting modules 10.
DETX  Further, since only one feeder 58 rather than two or more feeders 58 is
      operable to supply the LEDs 122 at the same stage in each one of the
      mounting modules 10, it might be considered that a plurality of feeders
      58 do not have to be constantly installed on each mounting module 10 as
      long as only one feeder 58 is constantly installed on the mounting module
      10. However, a plurality of feeders 58 may be installed on the mounting
      module 10, for enabling switching from one of the feeders 58 into another
      of the feeders 58, for example, when the number of the LEDs 122 remaining
      in the one of the feeders 58 becomes smaller than the number of the LEDs
      122 that are required to be mounted on a single row. This arrangement is
      desirable for reducing the number of times at which the operator is
      required to perform a manual operation for installation of the feeders 58
      onto the mounting module 10.
DETX  Further, in order to increase efficiency of the mounting work by the
      mounting module 10, it is desirable that the plurality of feeders 58 are
      installed in respective holding-portion positions that minimize a
      distance by which each LED 122 is to be carried by the mounting head 60,
      and it is desirable to employ, as the mounting head 60, the mounting head
      60b holding the plurality of suction nozzles 86b (e.g., twelve suction
      nozzles 86b).
DETX  In the following description, the attachment of the reel 140, on which
      the carrier tape holding the LEDs 122 (or resistors 190) as the
      electronic circuit components is wound, to the feeder 58 will be referred
      to as "mounting", while the attachment of the feeder 58 onto the holding
      base 150 holding portion 156) of the component supplying device 24 will
      be referred to as "installation". Further, in the following description,
      there will be used also an abbreviated expression that "the LEDs 122 (or
      resistors 190) are installed on the holding base 150, component supplying
      device 24 or mounting module 10", where appropriate.
DETX  In the present embodiment, the operator mounts the reel 140 holding the
      LEDs 122, onto the feeder 58, and then installs the feeder 58 onto a
      randomly selected one of the holding portions 156 of the holding base 150
      of a randomly selected one of the mounting module 10. After the manual
      operations have been thus carried out by the operator, the backlight is
      assembled in a manner dependent on the LEDs 122 actually installed on the
      mounting module 10. There will be described a process of assembling the
      backlight, by way of example, with reference to FIGS. 11-15. FIG. 11 is a
      flow chart showing an operation flow carried out for principally setting
      up an arrangement required for assembling the backlight. In FIG. 11,
      steps indicated by broken lines are steps that are to be implemented
      manually by the operator or implemented by the assembling system in
      accordance with commands supplied from the operator, while steps
      indicated by solid lines are steps that are to be implemented
      automatically by the assembling system.
DETX  The operation flow of FIG. 11 is initiated with step S41 that is
      implemented to carry out a previous preparation, by using a personal
      computer 7, for creating a part of a sequence table that is to be used
      for mounting the LEDs 122 of M rows and N lines onto the multi-piece
      substrate 120.
DETX  The module controller 108 of each mounting module 10 stores therein a
      standard mounting program that is to be used commonly for all kinds of
      electronic circuit assembling works, namely, that is to be used for
      perform standard controls of the mounting module 10, so as to receive the
      electronic circuit components from the component supplying device 24 and
      mount the components onto the circuit board held by the circuit-board
      holding device 22. In most cases, this standard mounting program is used
      in combination with a mount data (described below) so as to serve as a
      particular mounting program for controlling assembling of a particular
      electronic circuit. In the present embodiment, a backlight assembling
      routine designed for mounting the LEDs 122 onto the multi-piece substrate
      120 is added to the standard mounting program, so as to constitute a
      basic backlight-assembling control program, and this basic
      backlight-assembling control program is used in combination with the
      mount data and correlation data (described below), so as to serve a
      particular backlight-assembling control program. To this end, various
      kinds of data are created for each mounting module 10. The mount data
      includes the sequence table shown in FIG. 12 and a device table shown in
      FIG. 13. The backlight assembling routine may be created by an user.
      However, in the present embodiment, the backlight assembling routine is
      created by the manufacturer and is stored in a control device.
DETX  FIG. 12 shows, by way of example, the sequence table shows a series of
      mounting operations that are to be sequentially executed. In the sequence
      table in which the mounting operations are listed in order of the
      execution, "SUBSTRATE PIECE NUMBER" represents a number of the substrate
      piece as a kind of name of the mount area in which the component is to be
      mounted by each mounting operation, "COORDINATE" represents a mount
      position (X, Y coordinate) in which the component is to be mounted, and
      "SLOT NUMBER" represents the install position or component supply
      position. The sequence table correlates between each substrate piece
      (each mount area) and the corresponding mount-position group that is
      constituted by a plurality of mount positions within the substrate piece.
      In the present embodiment, a plurality of mount-position groups are set
      on the circuit board. Further, in the present embodiment, each one of the
      mounting modules 10 is assigned to mount the LEDs 122 onto a
      corresponding one of the substrate pieces of each multi-piece substrate
      120. In the present embodiment, since the feeder 58 on which the reel 140
      is mounted is a randomly selected one of the holding portion 156 of the
      holding base 150, the install position is not yet determined in the stage
      of the previous preparation, so that, as a part of the sequence table, a
      date representing a correlation among the "SUBSTRATE PIECE NUMBER",
      "SEQUENCE NUMBER" and "COORDINATE" is created. In this stage, the device
      table is not created. This data representing the correlation among the
      "SUBSTRATE PIECE NUMBER", "SEQUENCE NUMBER" and "COORDINATE" is created
      as a common data that is common to all the multi-piece substrates 120
      onto which the LEDs 122 are to be mounted in the mounting modules 10.
DETX  Thereafter, in step S42, the sequence table is transmitted to the host
      computer 8, and is then transmitted from the host computer 8 to the
      mounting modules 10 and optionally to the other component apparatuses
      that cooperate with the module line 5 to constitute the assembling
      system. Next, in step S43, the operator mounts the reel 140 storing the
      LEDs 122, on a randomly selected one of the feeders 58. In this instance,
      the operator causes the barcodes 142, 144 provided on the respective reel
      140 and feeder 58, to be read by a barcode reader 210 (see FIG. 1). This
      barcode reader 210 is connected to the personal computer 7, the host
      computer 8 or another computer, so that the connected computer creates a
      feeder/LED correlation table that correlates between the brightness level
      of the LEDs 122 stored by the reel 140 and the feeder ID of the feeder
      58. The created feeder/LED correlation table is transmitted to the module
      controller 108 of each mounting module 10 that is assigned to mount the
      LEDs 122 onto the corresponding substrate piece. The transmitted
      feeder/LED correlation table is stored in a memory of the computer of the
      module controller 108. The information obtained by the feeder/LED
      correlation table is a component-supplier/different-property-component
      correlation-related information.
DETX  Further, the above-described connected computer (to which the barcode
      reader 210 is connected) creates also a reel/feeder correlation table
      that correlates between the reel ID and the feeder ID. The created
      reel/feeder correlation table is also transmitted to the module
      controller 108.
DETX  Next, in step S44, the operator installs the above-described feeder 58 in
      a randomly selected one of the holding portions 156 of a randomly
      selected one of the mounting modules 10. Step S44 is followed by step S45
      in which the module controller 108 of the randomly selected mounting
      module 10 detects the install position in which the LEDs 122 have been
      installed and also the brightness level of the installed LEDs 122. Since
      the module controller 108 of the randomly selected mounting module 10
      obtains the feeder ID of each feeder 58 through the communication between
      the above-described communicating portions 112, 114, the module
      controller 108 of the randomly selected mounting module 10 can determine
      which one of the feeders 58 has been installed in which one of the
      install positions. Thus, based on information related to this
      determination, the above-described feeder/LED correlation table
      (previously obtained and stored in the memory) and the obtained feeder
      ID, it is possible to detect or automatically obtain a
      different-property-component-related information including the brightness
      level of the LEDs 122 and the install position of the feeder 58 that is
      to supply the LEDs 122 (i.e., the different-property-component supply
      position from which the LEDs 122 is to be supplied). The thus obtained
      different-property-component-related information is stored in memory
      means in the form of the memory of the computer. Further, the module
      controller 108 teaches the feeder controller 110 an initial component
      amount that is the number of the LEDs 122 initially stored in the feeder
      58, via the communication between the communicating portions 112, 114,
      and the feeder controller 110 stores therein the initial component amount
      as a remaining component amount at an initial stage. When the carrier
      tape is a new one, the number of the LEDs 122 stored in the carrier tape
      corresponds to the initial component amount, i.e., the remaining
      component amount at an initial stage.
DETX  As described above, the module controller 108 of the randomly selected
      mounting module 10 can determine the install position from which the LEDs
      122 are to be supplied and also the brightness level of the supplied LEDs
      122, so that the operator can install the feeder 58 into a randomly
      selected one of the install position. However, it is desirable that the
      operator takes account of matters that are inherent to the mounting of
      the LEDs 122, when mounting the reel 140 onto the feeder 58 and
      installing the feeder 58 onto the mounting module 10. In the present
      embodiment, it is not essential that the feeder 58 is installed in
      accordance with a specific manufacturing plan prepared in advance, so
      that the backlight can be manufactured advantageously in a manner
      flexible and variable depending on situation changes.
DETX  Where there are a plurality of feeders that are arranged to supply the
      LEDs 122 of the same brightness level, such plurality of feeders may be
      installed in respective install positions. In the present embodiment, the
      regions for installation of the feeders 58 are predetermined such that
      the predetermined install regions are suitable for increasing efficiency
      of the mounting work by the mounting module 10. Further, in order to
      facilitate determination of a first one of the feeders 58 from which the
      LEDs 122 are to be taken in each mounting module 10 upon initiation of
      the assembly of backlights of each manufacturing lot, the first one of
      the feeders 58 is installed in a predetermined one of the install
      position. The other feeders 58 which are to supply the same LEDs 122 are
      installed in the other install positions that are adjacent to the install
      position of the first feeder 58.
DETX  With the above rule relating to the installation of the feeders 58, the
      LEDs 122 of a randomly selected one of the brightness levels are
      installed on a randomly selected one of the holding portions 156. In the
      present embodiment, the plurality of feeders 58 arranged to supply the
      LEDs 122 are installed on each of the mounting modules 10, and all of the
      LEDs 122 supplied from the plurality of feeders 58 have the same
      brightness level in some of the mounting modules 10 while all of the LEDs
      122 supplied from the plurality of feeders 58 do not have the same
      brightness level in the other of the mounting modules 10.
DETX  The mount data is created by automatically adding data of "SLOT NUMBER"
      into the sequence table of FIG. 12 and creating the device table of FIG.
      13, based on results of detection of the
      different-property-component-related information (install positions) of
      the LEDs 122. The device table of FIG. 13 correlates between each "SLOT
      NUMBER" and the corresponding "LED" as a "COMPONENT NAME". The "COMPONENT
      NAME" is represented actually by a model number, and data indicative of
      shape and dimensions of each LED 122 as data defining contour of each
      electronic circuit component is read out from the database stored in the
      host computer 8, based on the model number. The read data indicative of
      shape and dimensions of the LED 122 is used when the image of the LED 122
      is taken by the component-image taking device 30 and when an error of
      position of the LED 122 held by the suction nozzle 86 is obtained. Thus,
      the data indicative of the "COMPONENT NAME" corresponds to the data
      defining the contour of the LED 122, and the "COMPONENT NAMES" of the
      LEDs 122 are the same to one another, irrespective of whether the
      brightness levels of the respective LEDs 122 are the same to one another
      or different from one another.
DETX  Onto the mounting module 10 assigned to mount the resistors 190 onto the
      substrate piece 124, the resistor 190 are installed by the operator. The
      installation of the resistors 190 is made in the same manner as the
      installation of the LEDs 122 onto the mounting modules 10. The operator
      operates the barcode reader 210 to read the barcode 142 provided on a
      randomly selected one of the reels 140 storing the resistors 190 and also
      the barcode 144 provided on a randomly selected one of the feeders 58,
      and then mounts the randomly selected reel 140 onto the randomly selected
      feeder 58. Upon mounting of the randomly selected reel 140 onto the
      randomly selected feeder 58, the personal computer 7, host computer 8 or
      another computer creates a feeder/resistor correlation table that
      correlates between the resistance value of the resistors 190 stored by
      the reel 140 and the feeder ID of the feeder 58. The created
      feeder/resistor correlation table is transmitted to the module controller
      108 of the downstream-most one of the mounting modules 10, and is then
      stored in the memory of the computer of the module controller 108. The
      information obtained from the feeder/resistor correlation table is a
      component-supplier/associated-component correlation-information. Then,
      the operator installs the feeder 58 (on which the reel 140 is mounted)
      onto a randomly selected one of the holding portions 156 of the holding
      base 150 of the downstream-most mounting modules 10. Upon installation of
      the feeder 58 onto the randomly selected one of the holding portion 156,
      the module controller 108 of the downstream-most mounting modules 10
      detects which one of the install positions the resistors 109 have been
      installed into and also which one of the resistance values the installed
      resistors 109 have, so that the module controller 108 obtains an
      associated-component-related information including the supply position
      and resistance value of the resistors 109.
DETX  The operator estimates or calculates, based on the brightness level of
      the LED 122 on hand, the resistance value required for controlling the
      electric current that is to be supplied to the LED 122, and then install
      the resistors 190 having the required resistance value, onto the holding
      base 150. The resistance value required for establishing uniformity in
      the brightness of the LEDs 122 can be obtained by a single resistor 190
      in some case, and can be obtained by a combination of a plurality of
      resistors 190 in other case. Therefore, the operator installs the
      resistors 190 of a plurality of kinds (which are expected to be used)
      onto the holding base 150. In this instance, it is desirable to install,
      onto the holding base 150, a plurality of feeders 58 holding the
      resistors 190 of at least one kind, a large amount of which are expected
      to be used. Further, although each feeder 58 holding the resistors 190
      may be installed, basically, onto a randomly selected one of the holding
      portions 156, it is desirable to install each feeder 58 in such a
      position that maximizes efficiency of the mounting work by the mounting
      module 10. To this end, for example, the feeder or feeders 58 supplying
      the resistors 190 of the kind that is to be used more frequently than the
      resistors 190 of the other kinds, are mounted preferably in a position or
      positions close to the resistor mount area 194 within the substrate piece
      124 of the multi-piece substrate 120 held by the circuit-board holding
      device 22, namely, in the position or positions substantially aligned
      with the resistor mount area 194 in a direction parallel to in the
      circuit-board conveyance direction.
DETX  After the set-up works have been completed as described, the mount works
      for mounting the multiplicity of LEDs 122 onto the multi-piece substrate
      120 are carried out by the mounter line 5. In the present embodiment, the
      multi-piece substrate 120 has a size that permits the substrate 120 to be
      held by each one of the mounting module 10 and to be subjected to the
      mount work carried out by the same mounting module 10, and is to be
      conveyed while taking such a posture that causes a longitudinal direction
      of the substrate piece 124 to be parallel to the conveyance direction. In
      step S46, the operator inputs the multi-piece substrate 120 provided with
      the substrate ID, into the substrate ID reading unit 1. Then, in step
      S47, the substrate ID of the substrate 120 is read by the substrate ID
      reading unit 1, and the cream solder is printed onto the substrate 120,
      with a pattern in accordance with the read substrate ID, by operation of
      the solder printer 3. In the present embodiment, the transmission of the
      substrate ID from the substrate ID reading unit 1 to a controller of the
      solder printer 3 is made via the host computer 8, although it can be made
      directly from the reading unit 1 to the controller of the solder printer
      3. The other information transmission between the other component
      apparatuses also may be made either directly therebetween or indirectly
      via the host computer 8.
DETX  After the cream solder has been printed onto the multi-piece substrate
      120, the substrate 120 is conveyed to the substrate ID reading unit 4 so
      that the substrate ID is read again by the substrate ID reading unit 4.
      Although the substrate ID obtained by the substrate ID reading unit 1 can
      be used in the mounter line 5, the substrate ID is read again in the
      present embodiment, because the multi-piece substrate 120 could be taken
      out from the component apparatuses such as the substrate ID reading unit
      1 and solder printer 33 after the substrate ID has been read by the
      substrate ID reading unit 1. After the substrate ID has been read by the
      substrate ID reading unit 4, step S48 is implemented to mount the LEDs
      122 rate the multi-piece substrate 120, based on the above-described
      basic backlight-assembling control program and the mount data created in
      step S45.
DETX  For carrying out the mounting work, the basic backlight-assembling
      control program is used. FIG. 15 is a flow chart of a part of the basic
      backlight-assembling control program, which is related to supply of the
      electronic circuit components and which is constituted principally by the
      above-described backlight assembling routine. During assembly of the
      backlight, prior to mounting of the LEDs 122 onto each substrate piece
      124, step S51 is implemented to judge whether the mounting of the LEDs
      122 onto the entirety of the single substrate piece 124 can be completed
      by the LEDs 122 remaining in the feeder 58 that is currently supplying
      the LEDs 122. If a positive judgment (YES) is obtained in step S51, the
      control flow goes to step S52 in which the mounting of the LEDs 122 is
      carried out with supply of the LEDs 122 from the same feeder 58, and a
      data correlating between the number of the substrate piece 124 and the
      brightness level as a part of a manufacturing record information is
      stored in memory means in the form of the memory of the computer of the
      module controller 108. The data correlating between the number of the
      substrate piece 124 and the brightness level may be, for example,
      indicative of correlation among the name of the basic
      backlight-assembling control program, the substrate (multi-piece
      substrate) ID, the brightness level and the number of the substrate piece
      124. The mounting is carried out in accordance with the sequence data,
      and the mounting head 60 is moved to one of the holding portions 156
      which is specified by the "SLOT NUMBER", so as to take the LED 122 from
      the feeder 58 and mount the feeder 58 into a given position within the
      substrate piece 124. It is noted that the brightness level included in
      the manufacturing record information is obtained from the
      different-property-component-related information stored in the memory.
DETX  The above-described data (indicative of correlation between the number of
      each substrate piece 124 and the brightness level), which is included in
      the manufacturing record information, is a data correlating between each
      mount-position group (constituted by the plurality of mount positions)
      and the brightness level of the different-property components, which are
      to be correlated with the mount-position group, namely, which are to be
      mounted in the mount-position group, and constitutes a
      substrate-piece/brightness-level correlation data for each circuit board.
      Further, the above-described data is obtained in correlation with the
      substrate ID for each circuit board. The substrate-piece/brightness-level
      correlation data may be constituted by a substrate-piece/brightness-level
      correlation table, as shown by way of example in FIG. 14, which is
      created for a substrate identification code (substrate ID) of each
      multi-piece substrate 120, and which correlates between the number n
      ("SUBSTRATE PIECE NUMBER") of each substrate piece 124 and the brightness
      level ("BRIGHTNESS LEVEL") of the LEDs 122 mounted on the same substrate
      piece 124. Thus, through the "SUBSTRATE PIECE NUMBER", a correlation
      between the mount-position group of each substrate piece 124 in the
      sequence table and the brightness level in the
      substrate-piece/brightness-level correlation data is established. The
      substrate-piece/brightness-level correlation table of FIG. 14 shows a
      case where the LEDs 122 to be mounted onto a single multi-piece substrate
      120 have two brightness levels. However, there is a case where all the
      LEDs 122 to be mounted onto a single multi-piece substrate 120 have the
      same brightness level, and also there is a case where the LEDs 122 to be
      mounted onto a single multi-piece substrate 120 have three or more
      brightness levels.
DETX  It is noted that the substrate-piece/brightness-level correlation data as
      a mount-position-group/property-related-information correlation data may
      be created apart from the manufacturing record information, for example,
      upon installation of each feeder onto the holding base 150. Since the
      brightness level of the LEDs 122 supplied by the feeder can be obtained
      upon installation of the feeder onto the holding base 150, it is possible
      to create, in advance, a correlation table correlating between the number
      of each substrate piece and the brightness level, so that the "SLOT
      NUMBER" in the sequence table is determined based on this correlation
      table created in advance. When an actual brightness level of the LEDs 122
      actually mounted on the substrate piece is different from the brightness
      level of this correlation table, the brightness level of this correlation
      table is changed or updated to the actual brightness level.
DETX  When each one of the LEDs 122 is mounted onto the multi-piece substrate
      120, the number of the remaining components memorized in the feeder
      controller 110 is reduced by one. This number of the remaining components
      is supplied from the feeder controller 110 to the module controller 108,
      and the above-described judgment of step S51 is made based on the
      supplied number of the remaining components. Upon completion of the
      component mounting work carried out for the circuit board 57, the number
      of the remaining components is supplied from the feeder controller 110 to
      the module controller 108, and is stored as a data correlated to the reel
      ID. By correlating the number of the, remaining components with the reel
      ID, the number of remaining components (i.e., the number of the LEDs 122
      remaining in the feeder 58) is given as the initial component amount to
      the feeder controller 110 that is configured to the feeder 58 installed
      on the holding base 150.
DETX  In the present embodiment, in the event of failure in mounting of one of
      the LEDs 122 by the suction nozzle 86b of the mounting head 60b, a
      recovery operation is executed for compensating the failure, so that
      another one of the LEDs 122 is additionally consumed each time the
      recovery operation is executed. Therefore, the number of the remaining
      components is reduced by one, upon execution of the recovery operation.
DETX  The above-described judgment of step S51 (as to whether the mounting of
      the LEDs 122 onto the entirety of a single substrate piece 124 can be
      completed by the LEDs 122 remaining in the feeder 58) can be made, in
      principle, by comparing the required number N of the LEDs 122 (that are
      to be required to be mounted onto the single substrate piece 124) with
      the number of the remaining components. However, in the present
      embodiment in which the above-described recovery operation is executed, a
      positive judgment (YES) is obtained in step S51, when the number of the
      remaining components is larger than a sum of the required number N and an
      additional number that is determined depending on a possible frequency of
      execution of the above-described recovery operation.
DETX  When a negative judgment (NO) is obtained in step S51, the control flow
      goes to step S58 that is implemented to judge whether or not there is
      another feeder 58 that is installed on the holding base 150, namely,
      judge whether or not there is installed another feeder 58, which is ready
      for supplying the LEDs 122, as a feeder succeeding the currently operated
      feeder 58 in which the number of the remaining LEDs 122 becomes
      insufficient for completing the mounting of the LEDs 122 onto the single
      substrate piece 124. When a positive judgment (YES) is obtained in step
      S53, step S54 is implemented to judge whether or not the brightness level
      of the LEDs 122 that to be supplied by the succeeding feeder 58 is the
      same as that of the LEDs 122 supplied by the currently operated feeder
      58. In the present embodiment, the operator is scheduled to mount the
      LEDs 122 into a vacant install position at a randomly selected stage, so
      that the brightness level of the LEDs 122 that is to be supplied by the
      succeeding feeder 58 is not necessarily the same as that of the LEDs 122
      supplied by the currently operated feeder 58, where the plurality of
      feeders 58 are installed on the mounting module 10. Like in the
      above-described set-up work, in the installation of the feeder 58 carried
      out at the randomly selected stage, the feeder/LED correlation table is
      created and is then transmitted to the module controller 108, so that the
      different-property-component-related informations of the LEDs 122 (that
      are to be supplied from the succeeding feeder 58) are detected together
      with determination of the install position in which the succeeding feeder
      58 is installed and determination as to which one of the feeders 58 is
      installed as the succeeding feeder 58. The determination of step S54 is
      made based on all of the detected different-property-component-related
      informations. Further, each time when the feeder 58 is mounted onto the
      mounting module 10 by the operator, the above-described device table of
      FIG. 13 is updated.
DETX  When a positive judgment (YES) is obtained in step S54, namely, when the
      feeder 58 is installed on the same mounting module 10 with the installed
      feeder 58 being to supply the LEDs 122 whose brightness level is the same
      as the currently supplied LEDs 122, the control flow goes to steps
      S55-S59 that are implemented to preliminarily notice shortage of the
      components, mount the LEDs 122 (having the same brightness level and
      supplied from the two feeders 58) onto the multi-piece substrate 120, and
      store data related to record the manufacturing record. Specifically
      described, step S55 is implemented to judge whether a total number p of
      the LEDs 122 having the same brightness level and stored in all the
      feeders 58 installed on the mounting module 10 is equal to or larger than
      a predetermined number P. When a negative determination (NO) is obtained
      in step S55, the control flow goes to step S56 to preliminarily notice
      the component shortage. When a positive determination (YES) is obtained
      in step S55, the control flow goes to step S57 to cancel the notice of
      the component shortage. That is, even when the component shortage has
      been once noticed as a result of the negative judgment (NO) in step S55,
      the positive judgment (YES) can be obtained in step S55 if the feeder 58
      is replenished with the LEDs 122 having the same brightness level as the
      LEDs 122 whose shortage has been noticed, so that the notice of the
      component shortage is canceled in step S57.
DETX  Step S56 or S57 is followed by step S58 in which all the LEDs 122
      remaining in the currently supplying feeder 58 are mounted onto the
      substrate piece 124. Then, after all the LEDs 122 remaining in the feeder
      58 have been mounted onto the substrate piece 124, step S59 is
      implemented. In this step S59, the LEDs 122 are taken from the succeeding
      feeder 58 (In this instance, "SLOT NUMBER" is changed in the sequence
      table of FIG. 12.), so as to be mounted onto the substrate piece 124, and
      the manufacturing record correlating between the number of the substrate
      piece 124 and the brightness level is stored. By implementation of step
      S58, even in case of the negative judgment (NO) in step S51, it is
      possible to avoid the feeder 58 from being uninstalled from the mounting
      module 10, with the LEDs 122 (whose number is smaller than the
      above-described sum of the required number N and the additional number)
      being left in the feeder 58. That is, it is possible to waste the LEDs
      122. On the other hand, when a negative judgment (NO) is obtained in step
      S54, the control flow goes to step S60. In this step S60, the LEDs 122,
      whose brightness level is different from the previously installed LEDs
      122, are mounted onto the substrate piece 124, and the manufacturing
      record is stored. In this step S59, too, the "SLOT NUMBER" is changed in
      the sequence table.
DETX  Further, when a negative judgment (NO) is obtained in step S53, namely,
      when there is not another feeder 58 (other than the currently operated
      feeder 58) installed on the mounting module 10 and operable to supply the
      LEDs 122, step S61 is implemented to inform that the mounting module 10
      should be replenished with new LEDs 122, namely, to inform that a new
      feeder 58 should be installed onto the mounting module 10. In the present
      embodiment, this information is provided on a display of the host
      computer 8 and also on a display of the mounting module 10 that is to be
      replenished with new LEDs 122. The display of each of the host computer 8
      and the mounting module 10 serves as an indicator as an informing device.
      When new LEDs 122 have been installed onto the mounting module 10 in
      conformity with the information, a positive judgment (YES) is obtained in
      step S62, and then step S63 is implemented to judge whether or not the
      newly installed LEDs 122 have the same brightness level as that of the
      previously installed LEDs 122. When a positive judgment (YES) is obtained
      in step S63, the control flow goes to steps S64 and S65 that are
      implemented in the same manner as the above-described steps S58 and S59.
      Specifically described, in step S64, all the LEDs 122 remaining in the
      currently supplying feeder 58 are mounted onto the substrate piece 124.
      Then, in step S65, the LEDs 122 are taken from the succeeding feeder 56
      so as to be mounted onto the substrate piece 124, and the manufacturing
      record correlating between the number of the substrate piece 124 and the
      brightness level is stared. On the other hand, when a negative judgment
      (NO) is obtained in step S63, the control flow goes to step S60 in which
      the LEDs 122 supplied from the succeeding feeder 56 are mounted, onto the
      substrate piece 124, and the manufacturing record is stored. The
      replenishment of the mounting module 10 with the LEDs 122 is detectable
      by detection of the installment of the feeder 58 into a vacant one of the
      holding portions 156. In this instance, the
      different-property-component-related information of the newly installed
      LEDs 122 is detected, and the detected
      different-property-component-related information is used for changing the
      "SLOT NUMBER" of the sequence table. It is noted that the install
      position of the empty feeder 58 (in which no LED 122 remains) may be
      informed, so that the empty feeder 58 can be removed from the install
      position and the succeeding feeder 58 can be installed in the install
      position, in a response to the information.
DETX  Where the LEDs 122 supplied from the plurality of feeders 58 installed on
      the mounting module 10 (that is assigned to mount the LEDs 122 onto a
      plurality of substrate pieces 124) do not have the same brightness level,
      each of the LEDs 122 is mounted onto a selected one of the plurality of
      substrate pieces 124, which is selected depending on the brightness level
      of the mounted LED 122. In the present embodiment, the brightness level
      is changed when the "SLOT NUMBER" is added into the sequence table, so
      that the LEDs 122 of the plurality of kinds supplied from the plurality
      of feeders 58 can be mounted onto the multi-piece substrate 120 in the
      mounting module 10 as a single electronic-circuit-component mounter.
DETX  After step S52, S59, S60 or S65 has been implemented, step S66 is
      implemented to judge whether the mounting work that is to be carried out
      in the mounting module 10 has been completed or not. When a negative
      judgment (NO) is obtained in step S66, the control flow goes back to step
      S51. When a positive judgment (YES) is obtained in step S66, the control
      flow goes to step S67 that is implemented to supply the manufacturing
      record information to the host computer 8. The supplied manufacturing
      record information corresponds to a combination of the data stored in
      steps S52, S59, S60, S65 and correlating between the number of each
      substrate piece 124 and the corresponding brightness level, and other
      data indicative of, for example, identification codes of the suction
      nozzle 86b and feeder 58 having committed failure in the component
      mounting.
DETX  Thereafter, in step S68, it is judged whether the scheduled manufacturing
      has been completed or not. When the scheduled manufacturing has not yet
      been completed, the control flow goes to step S69 that is implemented to
      carry out procedures such as loading and unloading of the multi-piece
      substrate 120, so as to prepare for the next mounting work. Then, the
      control flow goes back to step S51. When the scheduled manufacturing has
      been completed, the control flow goes to step S70 that is implemented to
      shut down the process whereby the execution of the program is terminated.
DETX  When the mounting of the LEDs 122 onto the multi-piece substrate 120 as a
      single circuit board has been completely performed by operations of the
      plurality of mounting modules 10, a substrate-piece information including
      the brightness level is printed by the printing module 10 in step S49 in
      the flow of FIG. 11. The multi-piece substrate 120 transferred into the
      printing module 10 is held by the circuit-board holding device 22 in the
      same manner as when the electronic circuit components have been mounted
      onto the substrate 120 in the mounting work. The printing head 170 is
      moved by the head moving device 62 so as to be positioned sequentially in
      a plurality of positions which are located on a horizontal plane and
      which are opposed to the respective barcode print areas 196 of the
      respective substrate pieces 124, so as to print the barcodes in the
      respective barcode print areas 196, whereby the brightness levels (as the
      property-related information) are provided to be correlated with the
      respective mount-position groups within the circuit board. The printing
      head 170 is first moved to an initial position which is aligned with an
      end portion, in the X-axis direction, of the barcode print area 196, and
      which is so close to an upper surface of the substrate piece 124 that the
      barcode can be printed on the upper surface by ejection of ink droplets
      from the printing head 170. Then, the printing head 170 is moved relative
      to the substrate piece 124 in the X-axis direction while being operated
      to eject the ink droplets toward the barcode print area 196, so as to
      print the barcode (representing the substrate-piece information) onto the
      barcode print area 196. The substrate-piece information includes at least
      the brightness level of the LEDs 122, and can be obtained from the
      manufacturing record information which is stored in steps S52, S59, S60,
      S65 and which includes data correlating between the number of each
      substrate piece 124 and the brightness level of the LEDs 122 mounted on
      the substrate piece 124. In the present embodiment, the manufacturing
      record information is supplied to the host computer 8 from the module
      controller 108 of the mounting module 10 that is assigned to mount the
      LEDs 122 onto the substrate piece 124, and is then supplied from the host
      computer 8 to the module controller 108 of the printing module 10.
DETX  After the barcodes have been printed onto the barcode print areas 196 of
      all the substrate pieces, the barcode reader 180 provided in the printing
      head 170 is moved sequentially to positions above the printed barcodes
      and is operated to read the informations recorded in the barcodes. Then,
      each of the read informations, i.e., informations actually recorded on
      the respective barcode print areas 196, is compared with the information
      supplied from the host computer 8, so as to confirm if the barcodes have
      been printed in conformity with the supplied information. This
      confirmation makes it possible to reliably avoid the subsequent
      procedures from being carried out for the substrate piece 124 onto which
      the information different from the supplied information has been
      recorded. However, the confirmation does not necessarily have to be done
      by reading the printed barcodes. When the recorded information matches
      with the supplied information, the recorded information is transmitted
      from the module controller 108 of the printing module 10 to the module
      controller 108 of the downstream-most mounting module 10 via the host
      computer 8 or without via the host computer 8. When the recorded
      information mismatches with the supplied information, this fact is
      indicated on the displays of the printing module 10 and the host computer
      8 whereby the operator is informed of occurrence of the failure. In this
      case, the multi-piece substrate 120 is not transferred to the
      downstream-most mounting module 10, and the operator is awaited to take
      the multi-piece substrate 120 out from the printing module 10, in a
      response to the failure information.
DETX  In the downstream-most mounting module 10, at least one of the resistors
      190 is mounted onto each of M pieces of the substrate pieces 124 of the
      multi-piece substrate 120 having barcodes printed thereon. In the host
      computer 8, the resistance value for each of the substrate pieces 124 is
      calculated based on the manufacturing record information, i.e., the
      brightness level of the LEDs 122 mounted on the substrate piece 124, such
      that the brightnesses of the M pieces of the substrate pieces 124 are
      equal to one another. Then, the host computer 8 calculates a resistor
      mounting data for obtaining the calculated resistance value in each of
      the substrate pieces 124. The resistor mounting data represents a
      required construction of the resistor circuit 200 in each of the
      substrate pieces 124, such as the number and kind of the resistors 190
      (that are to be provided in the resistor circuit 200) and mount (i.e.,
      connection) positions of the resistors 190 (in which the resistors 190
      are to be positioned in the resistor circuit 200). Where any one of the
      available resistors 190 does not have a resistance value equal to the
      calculated or required resistance value, the resistor circuit 200 may be
      constructed to include at last one series-circuit section (in which the
      resistors 190 are connected in series with each other) and/or at least
      one parallel-circuit section (in which the resistors 190 are connected in
      parallel with each other), so that it is possible to obtain the required
      resistance value in the resistor circuit 200 as a whole, which is
      different from the resistance value inherent to each resistor 190. In
      this sense, the resistor mounting data may be interpreted to represent a
      combination of the resistors 190 (such as least one series-circuit
      section, at least one parallel-circuit section and a combination thereof)
      that is to be established in the resistor circuit 200. It is therefore
      possible to establish any one of various resistance values in the
      resistor circuit 200, even if a few kinds of resistors 190 are available
      to the user. The created resistor mounting data is transmitted from the
      host computer 8 to the module controller 108 of the mounting module 10
      that is assigned to mount the resistors 190 onto the multi-piece
      substrate 120. It is noted that the resistor mounting data does not have
      to be created necessarily in the host computer 8 but may be created in
      the module controller 108. Further, the resistor mounting data may be
      created in a computer other than the host computer 8 and the module
      controller 108, such that the created resistor mounting data is
      transmitted to the module controller 108.
DETX  In the mounting module 10 assigned to mount onto the resistors 190 onto
      the multi-piece substrate 120, in general, the feeders 58 holding the
      resistors 190 projected to be mount onto the multi-piece substrate 120,
      are installed on the holding base 150, so that the resistors 190 are
      mounted onto the multi-piece substrate 120, in accordance with the
      resistor mounting data supplied from the host computer 8. Prior to the
      mounting of the resistors 190 onto the multi-piece substrate 120, it is
      checked whether or not the feeders 58 holding the resistors 190 of the
      required kinds are installed on the holding base 150. If some of the
      feeders 58 is not installed on the holding base 150, the operator is
      informed of shortage of the resistors 190 and kind of the resistors 190
      in shortage. Then, the mounting of the resistors 190 is started after the
      installation of the feeders 58 (i.e., the installation of the resistors
      190) has been completed. It may be checked, upon preparation of the
      resistor mounting data, whether or not the resistors 190 required for
      obtaining the desired resistance value are installed on the holding base
      150, so that the required resistors 190 can be assuredly installed on the
      holding base 150, by informing, in case in which the required resistors
      190 are not yet installed on the holding base 150, the operator of this
      fact.
DETX  In the resistor circuit 200, there is mounted at least one resistor 190
      that is dependent on the brightness level of the substrate piece 124. For
      example, in case of FIG. 10A for establishing the resistor circuit 200 in
      the form of a circuit (see (a1) of FIG. 10A) including a parallel-circuit
      section and a series-circuit section, the resistors 190 are disposed as
      shown in (a2) of FIG. 10A. In case of FIG. 10B for establishing the
      resistor circuit 200 in the form of a circuit (see (b1) of FIG. 10B)
      including only a series-circuit section, the resistors 190 are disposed
      as shown in (b2) of FIG. 10B. In case of FIG. 10C for establishing the
      resistor circuit 200 in the form of a circuit (see (c1) of FIG. 10C)
      including two parallel-circuit sections, the resistors 190 are disposed
      as shown in (c2) of FIG. 10C. In case of FIG. 10D for establishing the
      resistor circuit 200 in the form of a circuit (see (d1) of FIG. 10D)
      including one parallel-circuit section, a jumper 220 as well as the
      resistors 190 is disposed as shown in (d2) of FIG. 10D, such that the
      jumper 220 establishes connection between connection terminals between
      which the resistor 190 is not disposed. After the resistors 190 have been
      mounted onto all the substrate pieces 124, the circuit board 57 (i.e.,
      multi-piece substrate 120) i transferred to the reflow furnace 6.
DETX  As is clear from the above descriptions, in the present embodiment, among
      the eight mounting modules 10 cooperating with one another to constitute
      the mounter line 5, six mounting modules 10 are assigned to mount the
      LEDs 122 onto the multi-piece substrate 120. A portion of the module
      controller 108 of each of the six mounting modules 10, which is assigned
      to implement step S45, constitutes a different-property-component-related
      information detecting portion as a different-property-component-related
      information obtaining portion. A portion of the module controller 108 of
      each of the six mounting modules 10, which is assigned to implement step
      S48 for mounting the LEDs 122 onto the multi-piece substrate 120,
      constitutes a mounting controlling portion. The memory of the computer of
      the controller 108 of each of the six mounting modules 10, which is
      assigned to store therein the feeder/LED correlation table, constitutes
      memory means. Among the eight mounting modules 10, one mounting module 10
      is assigned to print the barcodes onto the multi-piece substrate 120, and
      a portion of the module controller 108 of the mounting module 10 assigned
      to print the barcodes, which is assigned to implement step S49,
      constitutes a property-related information providing portion. Among the
      eight mounting modules 10, one mounting module 10 is assigned to read the
      barcodes, and a portion of the module controller 108 of the mounting
      module 10 assigned to read the barcodes, which is assigned to read the
      barcodes, constitutes a property-related information reading portion as a
      property-related information recognizing portion. Among the eight
      mounting modules 10, one mounting module 10 is assigned to mount the
      resistors 190 onto the multi-piece substrate 120, and a portion of the
      module controller 108 of the mounting module 10 assigned to mount the
      resistors 190, which is assigned to implement step S50, constitutes an
      associated component mounting controlling portion.
DETX  The printing of the barcodes (each representing the information including
      the brightness level of the LEDs 122 mounted on the substrate piece 124)
      and the mounting of the resistors 190 (carried out in view of the
      brightness level) are also parts of the electronic-circuit assembling
      process. The manufacturing record information cooperates with the basic
      backlight-assembling control program to constitute the particular
      backlight assembling control program. It is also possible to interpret
      that the manufacturing record information includes a correlation table
      correlating among the substrate ID, substrate piece number and brightness
      level, and that a combination of this correlation table cooperates and
      the basic backlight-assembling control program is used in assembly of the
      electronic circuit.
DETX  The electronic-circuit assembling system may be a system including at
      least one electronic-circuit-component mounter that has a plurality of
      mounting devices. FIG. 16 shows an embodiment of such an
      electronic-circuit assembling system.
DETX  Although the electronic-circuit-component mounter included in, the system
      according to this embodiment is not yet publically disclosed, this
      electronic-circuit-component mounter will be described since it has a
      construction similar to that of an electronic-circuit-component mounter
      described in description of JP-2009-010319A, the assignee of which is the
      same assignee of the present application. In the following descriptions,
      the electronic-circuit-component mounter will be described, and the other
      component apparatuses will not be described since having substantially
      the same constructions as those of the electronic-circuit assembling
      system of the above-described embodiment.
DETX  The electronic-circuit-component mounter has a mounter main body 250 and
      a pair of component mounting portions 252, 254, as shown in FIG. 16. In
      the present embodiment, the component mounting portions 252, 254 are
      arranged in a circuit-board conveyance direction in which circuit boards
      258 are to be conveyed by a circuit-board conveying device 256 on a
      horizontal plane. The component mounting portions 252, 254 are
      symmetrical to each other with respect to a direction perpendicular to
      the circuit-board conveyance direction. The circuit-board conveying
      device 256 is constituted by, for example, a belt conveyor as a kind of
      conveyor, and is disposed on a base 260 of the mounter main body 250, so
      as to bridge between the component mounting portions 252, 254.
DETX  The component mounting portions 252, 254 are identical in contraction
      with each other, so that the component mounting portion 254, which is one
      of the mounting portions 252, 254 that is located on a downstream side of
      the other of the mounting portions 252, 254, will be described as a
      representative one of the mounting portions 252, 254.
DETX  The component mounting portion 254 includes a pair of component supplying
      devices 264, 266, a circuit-board holding device 268, a pair of mounting
      heads 270, 272, a pair of head moving devices 274, 276, a pair of
      component-image taking devices 278, 279 and a pair of fiducial-mark-image
      taking device (not shown). The component supplying devices 264, 266 are
      disposed on respective opposite sides of the circuit-board conveying
      device 256 in the Y-axis direction. Since each of the component supplying
      devices 264, 266 has a construction similar to that of the
      above-described component supplying device 24, the same reference signs
      as used in the above-described embodiment will be used to identify the
      functionally corresponding elements, and redundant description of these
      elements is not provided. Further, since the circuit-board holding device
      268 has a construction similar to that of the above-described
      circuit-board holding device 22, description of the holding device 268 is
      not provided.
DETX  The mounting heads 270, 272 and the head moving devices 274, 276 will be
      described.
DETX  Each of the head moving devices 274, 276 has a corresponding one of
      X-axis direction moving devices 280, 282 and a corresponding one of
      Y-axis direction moving devices 284, 286. Each of the Y-axis direction
      moving devices 284, 286 has a movable member in the form of a
      corresponding one of Y-axis slides 288, 290 and a movable-member moving
      device in the form of a corresponding one of linear motors 292, 294. Each
      of the Y-axis slides 288, 290 has a shape elongated in the X-direction,
      and is guided at its longitudinally opposite end portions by respective
      guide rails 300, 302 of a guiding device 298, so as to be movable and
      positionable in a randomly selected position in the Y-axis direction.
DETX  Each of the X-axis direction moving devices 280, 282 is disposed on a
      corresponding one of the Y-axis slides 288, 290, and includes a movable
      member in the form of a corresponding one of X-axis slides 310, 312 and
      an X-axis-slide moving device (not shown). The X-axis-slide moving device
      includes a servo motor as a drive source and also a ball-screw mechanism
      (not shown). Each of the X-axis slides 310, 312 is guided by a
      corresponding one of guiding devices 318, 320 that include respective
      pairs of guide rails 314, 316. Each of the pairs of guide rails 314, 316
      consists of upper and lower guide rails. In FIG. 16, the upper guide rail
      is shown while the lower guide rail is not shown. Each of the X-axis
      slides 310, 312 guided by a corresponding one of the guiding devices 318,
      320 is movable and positionable in a randomly selected position in the
      X-axis direction on a corresponding one of the Y-axis slides 288, 290.
DETX  Each of the mounting heads 270, 272 is disposed on a corresponding one of
      the X-axis slides 310, 312, and is movable on a horizontal plane so as to
      be positionable in a randomly selected position within an area between
      the circuit-board holding device 268 and a corresponding one of the two
      component supplying devices 264, 266 which is located on the side of the
      mounting head 270 or 272. In the present embodiment, each of the mounting
      head 270, 272 is detachably attached to a corresponding one of the X-axis
      slides 310, 312, by means of an attachment mechanism that has
      substantially the same construction as the above-described attachment
      mechanism by which the above-described mounting head 60 is detachably
      attached to the second X-axis slide 76. Each of the mounting heads 270,
      272 has substantially the same construction as the mounting head 60, and
      may be of various kinds different from each other with respect to number
      of nozzle holders. Further, the fiducial-mark-image taking devices (not
      shown) are disposed on the respective X-axis slides 310, 312.
DETX  Each of the mounting heads 270, 272 cooperates with a corresponding one
      of the head moving devices 274, 276 to constitute a corresponding one of
      mounting devices mounting devices 330, 332. Thus, the
      electronic-circuit-component mounter has a total of four mounting
      devices, such that two of the four mounting devices are provided in the
      component mounting portion 252 while other two of the four mounting
      devices are provided in the component mounting portion 254. In the
      present embodiment, LEDs are mounted onto substrate pieces by the
      mounting device 330 as one of the mounting devices 330, 332 of the
      component mounting portion 252 that is located on an upstream side of the
      component mounting portion 254, the feeders 58 holding the LEDs are
      installed on a feeder holding base in the component supplying device 264
      of the component mounting portion 252, and the barcodes are printed onto
      the substrate pieces by the printing head which is, in place of the
      mounting head 272, held by the X-axis slide 312 of the mounting device
      332 as the other of the mounting devices 330, 332 of the component
      mounting portion 252. The printing head has substantially the same
      construction as the above-described printing head 170, but does not have
      a barcode reader unlike the printing head 170. Further, in the present
      embodiment, the barcodes printed on the substrate pieces are read by a
      reading head which is, in place of the mounting head 270, held by the
      X-axis slide 312 of the mounting device 330 as one of the mounting
      devices 330, 332 of the component mounting portion 254 that is located on
      a downstream side of the component mounting portion 256, the feeders 58
      holding the resistors are installed on a feeder holding base in the
      component supplying device 266 of the component mounting portion 254, and
      the resistors are mounted onto the substrate pieces by the mounting
      device 332 as the other of the mounting devices 330, 332 of the component
      mounting portion 254. The reading head has a head main body and a barcode
      reader.
DETX  The mounting devices 330, 332 of the component mounting portion 252 and
      the mounting devices 330, 332 of the component mounting portion 254 are
      controllable by respective four computers constituting control devices
      (not shown) that are connected to the host computer.
DETX  In the electronic-circuit assembling system including the
      electronic-circuit-component mounter having the pair of component
      mounting portions 252, 254, too, the operation flow as shown in FIG. 11
      is carried out, whereby the LEDs and the resistors are installed onto the
      component mounting portions 252, 254, and LEDs and the resistors are
      mounted onto the substrate pieces. The LEDs are mounted onto all the
      substrate pieces of a single multi-piece substrate by operation of the
      mounting device 330 of the component mounting portion 252, and then the
      barcodes are printed onto the substrate pieces by operation of the
      printing head moved by the head moving device 276. In the present
      embodiment, the information (such as the brightness level of the LEDs),
      which are to be printed onto the substrate pieces, are obtained from the
      manufacturing record information supplied to the computer configured to
      control the mounting head 272 serving as the printing head from the
      computer configured to control the mounting head 270.
DETX  After printing of the barcodes onto the substrate pieces, the multi-piece
      substrate is transferred to the component mounting portion 254 that is
      located on the downstream side of the component mounting portion 252, and
      is held by the circuit-board holding device 268 of the component mounting
      portion 254. Then, in the component mounting portion 254, the reading
      head is moved by the head moving device 272, such that the barcodes
      printed on the substrate pieces are read by the barcode reader of the
      reading head. The resistor mounting data is created based on the
      brightness level of the LEDs that has been obtained from the read
      barcodes. Then, in the component mounting portion 254, the mounting head
      272 of the mounting device 332 is moved, so as to take resistors from the
      component supplying device 266 and mount the resistors onto the substrate
      pieces. The resistor mounting data may be created either in the computer
      configured to control the mounting head 270 of the component mounting
      portions 254 or in the computer configured to control the reading head
      (i.e., mounting head 272) of the component mounting portions 254. In the
      former case, the resistor mounting data created by the computer
      configured to control the mounting head 270 is transmitted to the
      computer configured to control the reading head. In the latter case, the
      information obtained from the read barcodes is transmitted to the
      computer configured to control the reading head so that the resistor
      mounting data can be created therein.
DETX  The two component mounting portions 252, 254 shown in FIG. 16 may be
      interpreted to constitute the respective electronic-circuit-component
      mounters. According to this interpretation, one of the plurality of
      electronic-circuit-component mounters of the electronic-circuit
      assembling system is assigned to mount the different-property components
      onto the circuit board and to provide the circuit board with the
      property-related information, while another one of the plurality of
      electronic-circuit-component mounters is assigned to recognize the
      property-related information and to mount the associated components onto
      the circuit board. Further, it is possible to interpret that the
      plurality of electronic-circuit-component mounters each having the
      plurality of mounting devices constitute the mounter line.
DETX  in the above-described embodiments, the multi-piece substrate is conveyed
      in the electronic-circuit-component mounter while taking the posture that
      causes the longitudinal direction of the substrate pieces to be parallel
      to the conveyance direction. However, the multi-piece substrate may be
      conveyed while taking the posture that causes the longitudinal direction
      of the substrate pieces to be perpendicular to the conveyance direction.
DETX  Further, where each one of the plurality of electronic-circuit-component
      mounters, which cooperate with each other to constitute the mounter line,
      is assigned to a corresponding part of the mounting work for the
      different-property components onto a single multi-piece substrate, each
      one of the electronic-circuit-component mounters does not necessarily
      have to be assigned to mount the different-property components onto an
      entirety of one of the substrate pieces of the single multi-piece
      substrate, but may be assigned to mount the different-property components
      onto at least a part of one of the substrate pieces.
DETX  In the mounter line 5 of the electronic-circuit assembling system
      according to the embodiment shown in FIGS. 1-15, it is possible to mount
      the different-property components onto a large-sized circuit board whose
      size as measured in the conveyance direction is larger than a size of
      each one of the mounting modules 10 as measured in the conveyance
      direction. In this case, the large-sized circuit board may be positioned
      over two or more of the mounting modules 10 so as to held by the
      circuit-board holding devices 22 of the respective two or more mounting
      modules 10. The different-property components can be mounted onto a
      portion of the circuit board which is located at a boundary between two
      adjacent mounting modules 10, by enabling the mounting head 80 to be
      reach this portion of the circuit board, with movement of the second
      X-axis slide 76 on the first X-axis slide 74 in the X-axis direction.
DETX  Further, in the mounter line, the property-related information may be
      provided on a back surface of the circuit board which is opposite to the
      mount surface of the circuit board onto which the different-property
      components are mounted. In this case, for example, the
      property-related-information providing head may be positioned on a side
      of the back surface so as to provide the back surface of the circuit
      board with the property-related information. Alternatively, a board
      inverting device may be incorporated into the mounter line, so as to be
      disposed on a downstream side of the electronic-circuit-component
      mounters that are assigned to mount the different-property components
      onto the circuit board. In this alternative arrangement, the circuit
      board is inverted by the board inverting device so as to cause the back
      surface as an information receiving surface to be face upwardly, and the
      inverted circuit board is transferred to the property-related information
      provider that is constituted by one of the electronic-circuit-component
      mounters which is located on a downstream side of the board inverting
      device, such that the property-related information is provided on the
      upwardly facing back surface of the inverted circuit board by operation
      of the property-related-information providing head. Moreover, as another
      alternative means, a property-related information provider, which is
      capable of providing the property-related information onto the back
      surface of the circuit board without necessity of inverting the circuit
      board, may be disposed on a downstream side of the
      electronic-circuit-component mounters that are assigned to mount the
      components onto the circuit board. Where the associated components are to
      be mounted onto the back surface of the circuit board, too, the board
      inverting device may be disposed in midway of the mounter line, such that
      the circuit board is inverted by the board inverting device after the
      different-property components have been mounted onto the circuit board,
      and the associated components are mounted onto the back surface of the
      circuit board within the mounter line.
DETX  Further, in the mounter line, the mounting of the different-property
      component onto the circuit board and the provision of the
      property-related information onto the circuit board may be carried out
      therein, while the recognition of the information provided on the circuit
      board and the mounting of the associated components onto the circuit
      board may be carried out by a single electronic-circuit-component mounter
      or two electronic-circuit-component mounters that are provided apart from
      the mounter line, or a property-related information recognizes and an
      electronic-circuit-component mounter that are provided apart from the
      mounter line. Further, alternatively, after having been provided with the
      information, the circuit board may be inputted again into the mounter
      line. Where the recognition of the information and the mounting of the
      associated components are carried out in a single working apparatus
      provided apart from the mounter line, a control device, which is provided
      for controlling the mounting of the associated components, may be
      configured to recognize the property-related information provided on the
      circuit board and then to mount, onto the circuit board, the associated
      components that are selected based on the recognized property-related
      information.
DETX  Further, as a part of the previous preparation, registration of the LEDs
      that are to be used for the manufacturing may be carried out.
      Specifically, the registration of the LEDs can be made by registering the
      initial component amount that is the number of the LEDs initially stored
      in each of the reels (that are to be used) and also the correlation
      between the reel identification code of each reel and the brightness
      level of the LEDs stored in the reel. Data indicative of the registered
      LEDs may be transmitted from a personal computer to the host computer, or
      may be inputted directly into the host computer. Further, the data
      indicative of the registered LEDs may be transmitted from the host
      computer to each of the component apparatuses of the assembling system.
DETX  Further, where ICs as well as the different-property components are
      disposed on a surface of the circuit board so that the surface does not
      have a space available for the provision of the property-related
      information, for example, the property-related information may be
      provided or printed onto an upper surface of IC disposed on the circuit
      board. This arrangement makes it possible to provide the circuit board
      with the property-related information without having to unnecessarily
      increase the size of the circuit board. Further, the property-related
      information may be provided on an upper surface of a chip of the IC.
DETX  The control device of the electronic-circuit-component mounter may be
      constructed to include a single computer or a plurality of computers that
      are connected to each other.
DETX  In the above-described embodiments, only the LEDs 122 having the same
      brightness level are mounted onto each one of the substrate piece 124.
      However, the brightness of the substrate piece 124 can be uniform over
      its entirety, also by an arrangement in which the LEDs 122 of first group
      and the LEDs 122 of second group are arranged alternately to each other
      (such that each adjacent two LEDs 122 consist of one of the LEDs 122 of
      the first group and one of the LEDs 122 of the second group), wherein the
      LEDs 122 of first group have the respective brightness levels which are
      the same to each other and which are different from the brightness levels
      of the LEDs 122 of the second group.
DETX  In the electronic-circuit assembling system according to the embodiment
      shown in FIGS. 1-15, when the amount of the components (i.e., amount of
      the LEDs 122 having the same brightness level) stored in all the feeders
      58 installed on the mounting module 10 (as a single
      electronic-circuit-component mounter) becomes smaller than the
      above-described predetermined number P, the shortage of the components is
      pre-noticed, for thereby advantageously avoiding operation of the
      mounting module 10 from being obligatorily stopped upon occurrence of
      actual shortage of the components. This arrangement may be modified such
      that, each time when supply of the LEDs 122 from each feeder 58 is
      completed, this completion may be informed to the operator, in addition
      to or in place of the pre-notice of the possible shortage of the
      components, so that the vacant feeder 58 can be quickly replaced with a
      new feeder 58 by the operator.
DETX  Further, only one feeder 58 rather than a plurality of feeders 58 may be
      constantly installed on the mounting module 10 (as a single
      electronic-circuit-component mounter), with an arrangement causing the
      feeder 58 to be replaced with a new feeder 58 each time when the amount
      of the LEDs 122 remaining in the installed feeder 58 becomes smaller than
      a required number for completing the mounting of the LEDs 122 onto the
      entirety of the substrate piece 124.
DETX  It is noted that the above modifications may be applied to the embodiment
      shown in FIG. 16.
DETX  In the embodiment shown in FIGS. 1-15, when it becomes impossible to
      complete the mounting of the components onto the entirety of the
      substrate piece 124, by supply of only the LEDs 122 remaining in the
      currently supplying feeder 58, it is judged whether there is another
      feeder 58 which is already installed on the same mounting module 10 and
      which is ready for supplying the LEDs 122 having the same brightness
      level as the currently supplied LEDs 122. However, this arrangement may
      be modified such that it is judged whether there is another feeder 58
      which is already installed on not only the same mounting module 10 but
      also another mounting module 10 and which is ready for supplying the LEDs
      122 having the unchanged brightness level. In this modified arrangement,
      after the LEDs 122 supplied from the feeder 58 installed on the same
      mounting module 10 have been mounted onto the substrate piece 124, the
      LEDs 122 supplied from the feeder 58 installed on the other mounting
      module 10 may be mounted onto the substrate piece 124, for completing the
      mounting of the components onto the entirety of the substrate piece 124.
DETX  Further, in each of the above-described embodiments, the single substrate
      ID is provided onto the entirety of the multi-piece substrate 120.
      However, where the manufacturing record is used even after the
      multi-piece substrate 120 has been divided into the substrate pieces 124,
      for example, it is desirable that the substrate ID is provided onto each
      one of the substrate pieces 124.
DETX  Still further, in each of the above-described embodiments, the brightness
      level of the LEDs 122 is made uniform over the entirety of each one of
      the substrate pieces 124. However, the brightness level of the LEDs 122
      may be made uniform over the entirety of the multi-piece substrate 120 or
      entirety of an ordinary substrate (that is other than a multi-piece
      substrate). In this case, the mounting work may be carried out, with the
      multi-piece substrate 120 or the ordinary substrate being handled as if
      being each one of the substrate pieces 124. In this modified arrangement,
      too, the electronic circuit components of the same kind may be installed
      on two or more of the mounting modules 10 constituting the mounter line 5
      of the electronic-circuit assembling system, so that the two or more
      mounting modules 10 cooperate with each other to mount the electronic
      circuit components of the same kind onto the entirety of the multi-piece
      substrate 120 or entirety of the ordinary substrate.
