PAL  An electronic business telephone for the transmission and receipt of voice
      messages and digital data. The electronic telephone uses MOS/LSI circuitry
      to store and visually display telephone numbers or other numeric data and
      includes the capability of performing local arithmetic computation. In
      telephone mode, after keyboard entry the number to be dialed is stored and
      visually displayed for pre-dial verification in articulated format with
      the area code, prefix and suffix suitably spaced for ease of reading. If
      the number is busy, the displayed telephone number can be entered into a
      telephone memory and the memorized number subsequently recalled on demand
      for automatic redial. In data terminal mode, digital numeric information
      is displayed in non-articulated or compressed format for visual
      verification prior to transmission and is exchanged between any two
      electronic telephone systems, or through proper interfacing, from an
      electronic telephone to a remote computer. In computation mode, the
      keyboard and display are used in conjunction with an arithmetic processor
      and an accumulating memory which may be used to perform calculations
      during telephone conversation if desired. The various operating modes are
      supervised and coordinated by a control center module in the form of a
      MOS/LSI BCD microprocessor which performs telephonic and data alignment
      functions. The Electronics Business Telephone is also shown as the central
      supervising unit within a total communications terminal system.

PAC  CROSS REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATION
PAR  This application is a continuation-in-part of our earlier filed copending
      U.S. patent application Ser. No. 351,745 entitled "Electronic Business
      Telephone" filed Apr. 16, 1973, now abandoned.
BSUM
PAC  BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
PAR  The present invention is a solid state electronic communications terminal
      which effectively combines telephone, data terminal and arithmetic
      computation capabilities. The terminal device herein referred to as the
      Electronic Business Telephone (EBT) transmits and receives both voice and
      data and includes the local capabilities of storing and displaying
      telephone numbers or other numeric information and performing arithmetic
      manipulation of entered data.
PAR  The two technologies of telephony and data telecommunications have
      developed more or less independently up to the present time. The interface
      between the two areas has been broadened to some extent lately in response
      to the need for communication of digital data between remote locations
      over conventional telephone common carrier lines. However, these two
      technologies have been "adapted" to each other's requirements rather than
      being truly integrated in the form of a totally new terminal device based
      on an optimized design approach which serves both functions effectively.
PAR  For example, various types of modems or acoustic couplers, such as the
      Western Electric Type 103A Data Set, marketed under the trademark
      "Data-Phone" by Bell System, have been developed under pressure from users
      of computer services in order to provide them with remote access to a
      central data processing installation through existing communications
      networks. Another typical device of this nature is shown in U.S. Pat. No.
      3,583,554, issued to Le Blang, which discloses a portable numeric display
      device with is acoustically or electromagnetically coupled to a selective
      tone generating telephone in order to adapt it to be used as a data
      terminal. Devices of this type are characterized by the common limitation
      that they act as an external adjunct to a conventional electromechanical
      telephone which activates or de-activates the standard electromechanical
      processes of the telephone.
PAR  Similarly in the area of electronic desk calculators, it has been suggested
      to adapt a conventional calculator to include the capability for entry and
      dialing of telephone numbers. Such an approach is discussed in generalized
      terms in British Pat. No. 1,179,585, issued to VEB Elektronische
      Rechenmaschinen which suggests that a "transmission channel" including a
      code conversion device be interposed between the keyboard entry register
      of the calculator and the telephone exchange device.
PAR  On the other hand, the telephone industry being considerably older and more
      firmly committed to existing methods and equipment, due in large part to
      economic considerations and historical inertia, has not effectively
      applied newly developed technology in computer systems design and
      microelectronics to its own customer terminal equipment. The three primary
      developmental stages of telephone equipment have involved the call
      placement function and are represented in terms of hardware by the crank
      telephone, the rotary dial telephone and the selective tone generating
      (e.g. Touch-Tone) telephone. The present invention represents the next
      evolutionary phase, the electronic telephone.
PAC  SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION
PAR  The present invention represents the first application of the combined
      technology of computer design and MOS/LSI microelectronics to the area of
      the basic business telephone unit. The inventive application and
      implementation of technical know-how developed outside the telephone art
      characterized by the BCD telephone of the present invention makes possible
      the optimized design of a totally integrated business communications
      system. More specifically, the electronic business telephone of the
      present invention (hereinafter referred to as the EBT) integrates into a
      single desk-top device a range of functions which achieves a utility level
      never before possible using common carrier lines.
PAR  The basic EBT design provides automatic push-button dialing in both rotary
      telephone and touch-tone telephone areas. After keyboard entry the number
      to be dialed is visually displayed in articulated format with spacing
      between area code, prefix and suffix for pre-dial verification and the
      number is automatically dialed on actuation of a single key. The displayed
      telephone number can be entered into a telephone memory register and the
      memorized number can be recalled on demand for automatic redial. In a
      Centrex-type PBX/PABX environment the appropriate access digit -- e.g. "9"
      -- is automatically impressed onto the telephone number prior to
      initiation of automatic dialing.
PAR  The electronic telephone digital display and the pushbutton keyboard can be
      utilized to perform arithmetic computations either during telephone
      conversation or separately when the instrument is not being used for voice
      communication. Computation results are displayed and partial results can
      be stored for accumulation. Finally, the EBT instrument functions as a
      data terminal whereby digital information can be visually verified and
      exchanged between any two electronic telephone systems, or through proper
      interfacing from electronic telephone to computer.
PAR  The total business communication system contemplated by the present
      invention combines the basic EBT unit with various peripheral devices
      which further increase the power and utility of the system. For example, a
      "Magna-Dialer" unit provides the facility of automatic dialing of
      telephone numbers magnetically prerecorded on conventional business cards
      which visually identify the party being called. An automatic call diverter
      unit allows incoming calls to be diverted to any phone or extension number
      stored in memory and allows a user to update the stored number from a
      remote location. Finally, a "multi-memory" repertory dialer provides
      automatic retrieval of frequently called numbers and entry into the
      electronic telephone for automatic dialing.

DETD
PAC  DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION
PAR  FIG. 1 pictorially illustrates the electronic business telephone of the
      present invention in the form of a desk set terminal shown generally at
      10. This unit will be referred to throughout the following description as
      the "EBT".
PAR  The operator interface with the EBT is provided by handset 12, which
      includes a conventional microphone pick up and speaker, keyboard 14 and
      digital display panel 16. The handset is used in the conventional manner
      as an electroacoustical transducer to convert audible sounds into
      electronic impulses and vice versa for two-way voice message
      communication. A suitable handset is commercially available for example
      from ITT under the model designation 510. Display panel 16 is also of
      conventional design and preferably is of the seven segment Nixie tube type
      such as the Burroughs Panaplex model. Keyboard 14 is likewise of
      conventional construction as exemplified by that available from Control
      Research Corp. Despite its conventionality the internal construction and
      operation of keyboard 14 will be described in more detail below in
      connection with FIG. 4 for purposes of clarity of presentation of the
      overall operation of the EBT system.
PAR  The external appearance of keyboard 14 is shown in expanded detail in FIG.
      1A which displays the various numeric data and function control keys.
      These keys will be briefly described at this point and their function will
      become more clear as the description of the organization and operation of
      the EBT system proceeds.
PAR  The digit keys "0" through "9" and the decimal key are grouped together and
      represent the means by which numerical data is entered into the EBT
      system. This data may represent for example the telephone number of a
      subscriber whom the EBT operator wishes to call, or numerical data to be
      used either for local arithmetic computation or for transfer to data
      processing equipment peripheral to the EBT desk unit.
PAR  The keys "PM", "RM", "OP" and "DIAL" are grouped together to the left of
      the digit keys and are used to control telephonic functions such as
      storage and retrieval of a telephone number to be dialed, operator
      summons, and automatic call placement. For example, the PM key
      (phone-memory) stores a telephone number displayed on display panel 16 in
      the EBT internal memory, while RM (recall memory) retrieves a number
      previously stored in memory and displays it on display panel 16 for
      automatic call placement on actuation of the DIAL key. The OP key calls
      the operator and the DIAL key causes the EBT to generate either a rotary
      pulse train or Touch-tone encoded signal representing the number visually
      displayed on panel 16 for transmission through the external common carrier
      network.
PAR  The "C" (clear), "CM" (clear memory) and "CE" (clear entry) keys which are
      grouped together at the extreme left of the keyboard as shown in FIG. 1A
      are used to clear either the number displayed on panel 16 (CE), the number
      stored in the EBT internal memory (CM), or numerical information in both
      locations (C).
PAR  The grouping of five keys immediately to the right of the digit key
      grouping are the function control keys used while the EBT is operating in
      arithmetic computation mode. These include the "AM" (accumulate memory)
      key which combines the number displayed on display panel 16 with the
      contents of the EBT internal memory whereby the memory functions as an
      arithmetic accumulator. This is especially useful in accumulating partial
      results of complex computations. The arithmetic operator keys ".div.",
      ".times.", " ", " " are used to control arithmetic functions in a manner
      similar to that in a conventional electronic desk calculator.
PAR  The three keys grouped to the right of the arithmetic function control keys
      are the data transmission function control keys "*", "-", and "SEND DATA".
      These keys are used when the EBT is operating in data terminal mode and
      their use will be understood to be essentially similar to that usually
      encountered with a Touch-tone type remote computer terminal device.
PAR  The two keys at the far right of the keyboard in FIG. 1A "SMM" (store
      multi-memory), and "RMM" (recall multimemory) are used when the
      multi-memory repertory dialer peripheral option is incorporated in the EBT
      system. The multimemory peripheral will be discussed below in connection
      with FIG. 3.
PAR  The final grouping of keys shown in FIG. 1A are the conventional line
      selection, intercom and hold keys commonly found on multi-line business
      telephones.
PAR  It will thus be seen that keyboard 14 includes various key groupings, each
      of which is conventionally associated with a single purpose device such as
      a telephone, electronic desk calculator or data terminal.
PAR  The overall organization of a preferred embodiment of the EBT system is
      shown in FIGS. 2 and 3. FIG. 2 illustrates the logical arrangement of
      functional sub-components internal to the basic EBT desk unit 10 as shown
      in FIG. 1, while FIG. 3 depicts the inter-relationship between the EBT
      desk unit and its various associated peripherals which together comprise a
      total electronic communications terminal system.
PAR  The manually operated keyboard 14 generates output signals on lines 18
      representing numeric information and function control commands. The
      internal construction and operation of keyboard 14 is more fully discussed
      below in connection with FIG. 4. As will be described the keyboard output
      signals are in time-multiplexed form and are generated by the interaction
      of a sequence of timing signals T1 through T12, supplied to the keyboard
      over line 20, with closure of internal switch contacts in response to
      operator key selection.
PAR  The time-multiplexed keyboard output signals are supplied over lines 18 to
      control center module 22. Those keyboard output signals representing
      telephonic and data terminal function control commands are processed
      within the control center module as will be more fully described below in
      connection with FIGS. 5A-B and FIG. 6. Those keyboard output signals
      representing numeric information and function control commands for
      computation, storage and display are gated through the control center
      module directly to processor module 24 over lines 26 for processing within
      that area. Processor module 24 may be of conventional design such as is
      typically found in electronic desk calculators.
PAR  It should be noted here that while FIG. 2 depicts various functional
      sub-components of the EBT device as discrete physical entities, this need
      not necessarily be the case. For example, the control center module and
      processor module may be physically contained on discrete MOS/LSI
      integrated circuit chips, or alternatively, several functions may be
      combined on a single chip. In the former case, as is shown in FIG. 2, a
      commercially available processor chip may be directly used in an EBT
      system with a minimum of interfacing, while in the latter case a custom
      design combination chip would be used with conventional subfunctions
      patterned after existing commercial circuits. Processor module 24 is of
      the type commercially available from Caltex under the designation CT5005.
PAR  The processor module has three processing sections designated in FIG. 2 as
      Arithmetic, Memory and Display Buffer. The display buffer section is a
      holding register which contains information currently being displayed on
      display panel 16. All numeric data entered from keyboard 14 are thus
      loaded directly into the display buffer section of the processor module
      and visually displayed on the display panel.
PAR  The memory section of the processor module provides the function of
      temporary storage of keyboard entered information for recall upon operator
      command when desired. The memory recall operation transfers the contents
      of the memory section into the display buffer and display panel
      overwriting their previous contents. This operation may be used for
      example in telephone mode in connection with the automatic redial
      function. In this instance assuming the operator has entered a telephone
      number into the display buffer and attempted call placement but has found
      the line busy he can press the PM (phone memory) button on the keyboard
      and store the busy number in memory. At a later time the operator merely
      presses the RM (recall memory) button on the keyboard and the previously
      entered number is transferred to the display buffer and visually presented
      on the display panel for pre-dial verification. The operator may either
      visually re-verify the number and then press DIAL to automatically place
      the call, or, if the re-verification is not needed, he may merely press RM
      and DIAL in rapid succession thereby immediately initiating automatic call
      placement.
PAR  In computation mode the memory is used in conjunction with the AM
      (accumulate memory) key as follows. Partial arithmetic results may be
      cumulatively entered into memory section upon actuation of the AM key each
      time it is desired to add the immediate computation results held in the
      display buffer to the running total being developed in the memory section.
      Use of either PM or AM keys to store information in memory will not
      disturb the contents of the display buffer which is changed only upon
      entry of new information from the keyboard through line 26, or by a recall
      memory command.
PAR  The arithmetic (ALU) section of the processor module provides the various
      arithmetic manipulation logic circuitry and storage registers
      conventionally associated with an electronic desk calculator.
PAR  In addition to the three basic processing sections described above the
      processor module also has input and output areas used in conversion of
      data from one coding system to another. For example, in the processor
      module input section the time-multiplexed keyboard output signals supplied
      via the control center module over line 26 are encoded into binary coded
      decimal (BCD) format for handling within the processor module. Similarly
      in the processor module output section the BCD numeric data is converted
      to seven segment form prior to transfer to the display panel over
      processor output line 28. This seven segment display data is also supplied
      to the control center module where it is immediately reconverted to BCD
      form for further processing therein as will be described below.
PAR  The processor module provides the source of system timing signals T1
      through T12 which are used throughout the EBT in various aspects of data
      decoding and function control. For example, the timing signals which are
      output from the processor on line 30 are supplied to the keyboard via line
      20 and used therein to encode keyboard information into time-multiplexed
      format. A timing synchronization signal is also supplied to the control
      center module over line 32 where it is used to reconstitute T1 through
      T12, decode certain time-multiplexed function control commands supplied
      directly from the keyboard and sequence various processing operations. The
      timing signals are also supplied via line 34 to peripheral bus 36 for
      transfer to the various EBT peripheral devices discussed in connection
      with FIG. 3. Finally, timing signals are supplied over line 38 to
      articulated display module 40 to control the display articulation function
      as follows:
PAR  The signals supplied from the display buffer section of the processor
      module to display panel 16 over line 28a may be displayed in either
      articulated or non-articulated format. Articulated format refers to that
      display arrangement most useful in telephone mode wherein the area code,
      prefix and suffix of the entered subscriber's number are appropriately
      separated for ease of reading. In numeric mode such as when the EBT is
      being used either for local computation or remote terminal data input the
      articulation function is not used and the entered numeric data is
      compressed to the right in the conventional manner. Articulation of the
      displayed numbers is controlled by mode switch 42. The internal design and
      operation of the articulated display module and its interconnection to the
      display panel is described below in connection with FIGS. 7 and 8. FIG. 7
      represents a "fixed articulation" scheme, while FIG. 8 depicts logical
      implementation of a "floating articulation" approach to display of entered
      telephone numbers.
PAR  The control center module processes input data entering either from the
      keyboard in time-multiplexed format over lines 18 or from EBT peripheral
      devices in BCD format over peripheral bus 36 and input lines 44. Keyboard
      data entered either directly or from the processor module is converted
      from time-multiplexed to BCD format while in the case of data transferred
      from the associated EBT peripheral devices the information is already
      encoded in BCD form. It will be appreciated that although only one line is
      shown in FIG. 1, in reality it consists of several information lines which
      together represent the data in coded form. As with the processor module,
      all data handled within the control center module is in BCD form. Thus
      display data in seven segment form which is also supplied over line 28b to
      the control center module is immediately reconverted to BCD for processing
      therein. After initial processing for display in the processor module
      input data is returned to the control center module for further processing
      to produce the desired automatic dialing signals and data transmission
      signals, or, in the case of local computation, remains in the processor
      module for arithmetic manipulation and display of results. The control
      center module also receives inputs in the form of a basic frequency
      F.sub.o from clock 46 and various optional external operating mode
      commands 48 which are selectable during assembly of the EBT.
PAR  For example, in telephone mode the number contained in the display buffer
      section of the processor module is processed within the control center
      module to generate either a Touch-tone or a rotary dial output over lines
      50 and 52 respectively depending on the external common carrier
      environment. In the data transmission mode numeric information processed
      within the control center module is supplied in BCD form over line 54 to
      the peripheral bus for transfer and processing by various EBT peripheral
      devices, for transmission to a remote data processing installation, etc.
PAR  When the EBT is operating in telephone mode in a Touch-tone environment the
      Touch-tone output representing the number to be dialed is supplied from
      the control center module over line 50 to Touch-tone generator 56 and
      thereafter through coupler 58 to a selected tip and ring pair 60.
      Similarly, in a rotary dial environment the pulse EBT representing the
      number to be dialed which is generated within the control center module is
      supplied over line 52 to dialer 62 which is in turn connected to the
      selected tip and ring pair. The Touch-tone generator, coupler0295 and
      dialer are all of conventional design and commercially available. For
      example, a suitable Touch-tone generator is available from NRMEC as Model
      No. 19042. The coupler may be, for example, a Microtran line transformer
      and the dialer (outpulser) may be of the reed relay type manufactured by
      Electronic Specialties, Inc.
PAR  Various conventional telephone accessories are shown in FIG. 2 connected
      below the selected tip and ring pair 60. For example, handset 12 (FIG. 1)
      may be directly connected to the tip and ring line or auto-switch 66 may
      be used to substitute optional speaker phone attachment 64 for "hands-off"
      operation. In addition the EBT desk unit 10 may be provided with a
      conventional backup dialer 68 for use in case of electronic system
      malfunction. In this situation the entire EBT desk unit would act
      essentially as a conventional telephone.
PAR  Tip and ring pair 60 is shown in FIG. 2 connected to a plurality of common
      carrier lines L1-L3 through a line selector 70. A voice connecting
      arrangement (VCA) option connects the line selector to the common carrier
      lines. Finally, an electronic tone ringer 78 may be interposed between the
      line selector and speaker 64a to provide an audible electronically
      generated ring as an alternative to an electromechanical bell ringing
      system. The common carrier lines L1-L3 are also connected through the tip
      and ring pair of various HBT peripheral devices.
PAR  Due to the incompatability of the two dialing mediums, pulse versus tones,
      most telephone systems do not permit mixing of keypad tone apparatus with
      rotary pulse dialing apparatus in a single installation. Because of this,
      it is common practice to convert all telephones to tone dialing whenever a
      minority of users wish to enjoy the advantages thereof. Since tone dialing
      is tariffed at a higher rate than pulse (to cover the cost of additional
      plant equipment required for tone recognition) the conversion to tone
      dialing, for the few, is usually inordinately costly.
PAR  The electronic business telephone of the present invention, on the other
      hand, permits tone or pulse dialing from a common keypad. Provision for
      automatic control of the dialing medium allows complete freedom of
      intermixing telephone types, thus eliminating the necessity of total
      conversion with its attendant cost. The value of mixed dialing is realized
      whenever: (a) a majority of phones are on rotary dial; (b) internal lines
      ("com-lines") are used; and (c) a minority of phones are to be provided
      with tone dialing capability for outside lines. Under these circumstances
      the tone dialing phones will be able to dial on com-line by automatically
      switching over to rotary dialing whenever a com-line is selected.
PAR  This flexibility of dialing medium is achieved by mixed dialing module 77
      (FIG. 2) which is connected between line selector 70 and control center
      module 22. In a multi-button keyset the com-lines are conventionally
      separated from the outside lines by relocating the "A-1" lead of the line
      selector. By detecting the current flow at the relocated A-1 lead
      terminal-- i.e., the common tie point of all com-line A-1 leads--a signal
      can be derived to control the dialing mode of the EBT.
PAR  For example, if a com-line is selected, the relocated A-1 lead terminal
      current flow can be monitored as, for example, by an optical coupler.
      Thus, the detected presence of current at this point will cause the mixed
      dialing module to generate a rotary/touch tone select signal which is
      supplied to the control center module over one of lines 48 (FIG. 2). (This
      signal is more specifically identified below in connection with FIG. 5B as
      being input to the CCM function control logic over line 202.)
PAR  Stored number dialers when installed behind a PABX system typically depend
      on a fixed delay redial means following detection of each level of access
      code. Since this fixed delay must be long enough to ensure the return of a
      dial tone before redialing, the user is inconvenienced by a compromised
      delay, perhaps three seconds, every time and dialer is used. Misdialing is
      possible whenever the exchange is busy for a period longer than the
      anticipated delay.
PAR  To eliminate this problem the electronic business telephone of the present
      invention utilizes a dial tone detector 79 which quarantees the presence
      of a dial tone before initiating a continue dial command. The stored
      number dialer, therefore, can dial through the access code or codes at a
      rate limited only by the traffic load at the exchange during dialing.
PAR  Dial tone detector 79 is also used to mute the speaker phone during the
      start of a call as follows. Because of the disparity between dial tone
      level and normal speech level, when using a conventional telephone
      speaker-phone the user must reduce the volume while initiating a call in
      order to avoid an unpleasantly loud dial tone level. After the call is
      established the volume must then be restored to an adequate conversation
      level. It should be noted that this disparity is a problem only in
      connection with hands off operation, since in handset operations the
      volume is limited by the CO. The speaker phone, however, is normally
      operated at a higher level than is the typical handset.
PAR  Dial tone detector 79 may be implemented by means of serial connection of a
      band pass filter having a medium "Q", an amplitude threshold comparator,
      and a minimum duration detector. The serial connection insures that an
      input signal must meet all of the requirements imposed by the various
      circuit elements before a final output indicating presence of a dial tone
      is generated. While not all of the three circuit elements are essential
      for dial tone detection, the chances of misdetection are reduced with each
      additional condition imposed by the corresponding element. The coincident
      output requirements of all three circuits greatly reduces the design
      complexity of each element if used alone, or in conjunction with only one
      other element.
PAR  Dial tone detector 79 is designed to recognize dial tones under adverse
      conditions such as in the presence of voice or other telephone company
      supervisory signals (party busy, trunk busy, audible ring, recorded
      messages, etc.) with a low probability of error.
PAR  As shown in FIG. 2 the band pass filter section of the dial tone detector
      79 is coupled to the selected tip and ring pair 60. The output of the
      filter is amplitude measured by the comparator, which in turn generates an
      output if the amplitude exceeds a predetermined threshold. Finally, if the
      duration of the comparator output exceeds the minimum interval of a preset
      timer a final output representing a high probability of dial tone
      detection is generated. This dial tone detector output signal is supplied
      to keyboard 14 (see FIGS. 2 and 4) where it initiates a dial command and
      to speakerphone 64 where it mutes the audible dial tone to conversation
      level.
PAR  FIG. 3 shows the EBT as part of an overall arrangement of optional devices
      which together comprise a complete electronic comminication terminal
      system. The EBT desk unit 10 is connected to the various associated
      peripheral devices through bus 36 which contains lines carrying the
      various numeric data, function control, timing and telephone signals. To
      the left of the EBT in FIG. 3 are shown two physically discrete peripheral
      devices; a conventional credit card reader 80 and a "Magnadialer" unit 82.
      The magnadialer unit is a magnetic stripe reader wherein telephone number
      and other identifying information relating to a given individual or
      business enterprise is magnetically encoded on a strip which is attached
      directly to that party's ordinary business card 84. The card corresponding
      to the party to be dialed is visually selected by the operator from a
      conventional calling card file and inserted into the magnadialer reader
      which interprets the magnetically encoded information and transmits it in
      BCD form to the EBT desk unit where it is used to generate the appropriate
      automatic dialing signals.
PAR  To the right of the EBT desk unit in FIG. 3 is a group of devices
      physically combined and shown within the dotted block 86. This peripheral
      assembly 86 may, for example, take the form of a wall mounted unit in
      proximity to the EBT desk terminal. Within this unit are devices providing
      the capabilities of remote mini-computer interfacing, automatic call
      diversion and repertory dialing.
PAR  For example, UART (universal asynchronous receive and transmit) device 90
      connects EBT unit 10 via peripheral bus 36 to mini-computer 92. The
      mini-computer may be stationed either on-site or at a remote location and
      may for example be used in a process control application for remote
      management of some physical system. When the EBT is used in data terminal
      mode, time-multiplexed keyboard data is converted to BCD form in the
      control center module and handled therein to produce BCD data output on
      lines 54 (FIG. 2). This information is supplied through peripheral bus 36
      and UART 90 to mini-computer 92 for computation or is used to generate
      control signals. Computation results or physical measurements are returned
      to the EBT for display through UART 90, peripheral bus 36 and input lines
      44. As will be seen more fully in connection with FIG. 5A these BCD input
      signals are converted to time-multiplexed form within the control center
      module 22 and supplied to processor module 24 over lines 26 for display on
      display panel 16. During data terminal operation mode switch 42 will be in
      its non-articulation position and the numeric data from mini-computer 92
      will be displayed in compressed form. The connection between UART 90 and
      mini-computer 92 may be either via a dedicated line or through the
      telephone network on a dial-up basis. In the latter case a suitable modem
      would be interposed between the UART and the common carrier line.
PAR  Peripheral assembly 86 also contains Touch-tone receiver 94. This device is
      useful for example when the EBT system is receiving information in
      Touch-tone form as from another EBT or a Touch-tone data set. The incoming
      Touch-tone data signals enter the EBT system through line selector 70
      (FIG. 2) and are supplied to Touch-tone receiver 94 through tip and ring
      pair 60, bus 36 and tip and ring pair 96. The Touch-tone receiver converts
      the incoming information into BCD form and outputs it on lines 98 to
      control center module 22 via peripheral bus 36 and data input lines 44 for
      processing and display.
PAR  Automatic call diversion is provided by call diverter 100 which is
      connected to the EBT desk unit via peripheral bus 36 and line 102. The
      call diverter unit is also connected to a dedicated common carrier line 74
      through line supervisor 104 and voice connecting arrangement (VCA) 106.
      Line supervisor 104 in turn receives the information portion of an
      incoming call over line 96a and the audible ring signal over line 108.
      After an enabling signal is received from the EBT over line 102 automatic
      call diversion proceeds as follows. An incoming call on a preselected line
      (e.g. L1) (FIG. 2) is routed by line selector 70 to dedicated line 72 via
      peripheral bus 36, tip and ring pair 96 and call diverter line supervisor
      104. At the same time the corresponding audible ring signal is supplied
      from line selector 70 to call diverter line supervisor 104 through ring
      line 76, peripheral bus 36 and ring line 108. Call diverter 100
      automatically routes the incoming call to the number previously stored in
      its internal memory through the dedicated common carrier line 74. The
      number stored in the call diverter internal memory can be remotely updated
      via line 102 as desired.
PAR  The remaining device within peripheral assembly 86 is multi-memory unit
      110.
PAR  Briefly, this multi-memory unit is a keyboard addressable repertory dialing
      memory which contains a plurality of frequently called telephone numbers.
      A desired number may be automatically selected by the EBT operator upon
      actuation of the RMM key on keyboard 14 together with a two or three digit
      identification code. The number selected will be displayed on display
      panel 16 for pre-dial verification if desired and the call is
      automatically placed by actuation of the Dial key. Multi-memory unit 110
      may also be updated from the keyboard to include new telephone numbers as
      follows. The new number is entered into the display buffer section of the
      processor module and displayed on the display panel. The operator then
      selects an identification code which is also placed in the display buffer
      and the SMM key is pressed, automatically loading the new number into the
      multi-memory unit storage area under location control of the corresponding
      identification code.
PAR  It is to be understood that the overall system depicted in FIG. 3 is
      presented by way of general illustration of the manner in which the EBT
      may function as the central supervising device within an electronic
      communications terminal system. Those peripheral devices shown in FIG. 3
      which are not conventional are described in sufficient detail to permit
      implementation of the overall system in my copending patent applications
      referenced above.
PAR  FIG. 4 schematically illustrates the internal construction of keyboard 14.
      A series of timing input lines D1 through D12 (lines 20, FIG. 2) are
      arranged at right angles with respect to three output lines KB1, KB2 and
      KB3 (lines 18, FIG. 2). Any of the timing lines can be electrically
      connected to any of the output lines at their intersection by a switch
      contact actuated by a corresponding key on the keyboard. FIG. 4
      illustrates these connections as mechanical switches, however, it will be
      understood that electronic switches may be used for reasons of speed and
      reliability.
PAR  The individual keys corresponding to each of the various intersection
      switches are shown immediately to the right of the corresponding contact.
      Thus, the digits O through 9 will be output on line KB1 at designated
      times. For example, depression of the keyboard key for the digit 9 will
      cause timing line D6 to be connected to output line KB1. Lines D1 through
      D12 are supplied with timing signals T1 through T12 shown diagramatically
      at the upper portion of FIG. 4. Thus, line D6 will receive a timing pulse
      at time T6 and with the 9 key depressed that pulse will be output on line
      KB1 at time T6. The control center, and processor modules will interpret a
      signal on line KB1 at time T6 as the digit 9 and will convert that digit
      into BCD form for internal processing and to seven segment form for
      display. In FIG. 4 the decimal and sign keys, the memory control keys, and
      the three clear keys will be output on line KB2. Similarly, the telephonic
      keys Dial, Send Data, Operator, * and percent signals will be output on
      line KB3. Timing line D1 and output line KB3 are momentarily connected by
      a set of contacts which are responsive to activation of the EBT power-on
      switch and provide a reset signal for all system bistable devices.
PAR  FIG. 4 also shows the timing signals T1 through T12 being supplied over
      lines D1 through D12 to an idealized peripheral device 118. These timing
      signals are used within the peripheral device for appropriate decoding and
      function sequencing. In turn the peripheral returns peripheral control
      signals to the keyboard over line 120 for output to the control center
      module over line KB3.
PAR  FIGS. 5A and 5B together comprise a data flow diagram illustrating the
      functional sub-components within control center module 22 and their
      logical interconnection. The major functional units contained within the
      control center module include the following: BCD-keyboard logic section
      140; timing section 150; rotary formatter section 160; Touch-tone encoder
      section 170; BCD encoder-formatter 180; four-bit digit register 190; and
      function control block 200 which is shown in expanded detail in FIG. 6.
PAR  BCD-keyboard logic section 140 provides the interface between control
      center module inputs from the keyboard and from peripheral devices on one
      hand and the processor module on the other. BCD data from peripheral bus
      36 enters the control center module on lines 44 and is immediately decoded
      within logic block 140 by BCD to hex-decimal decoder 142. Since the
      processor module is designed to accept input data only in time-multiplexed
      form, the BCD data entering the control center module on lines 44 from the
      peripheral devices must be converted into that form before being supplied
      to the processor module. This function is accomplished within logic block
      140 by the combination of BCD decoder 142 and a series of AND-gates 144
      connected to corresponding outputs of decoder 142.
PAR  The BCD data from peripheral bus 36 (FIG. 2) is supplied on input lines 44
      as four-bits of data on lines DI-01, DI-02, DI-03 and DI-04, together with
      a data strobe signal DAS. The function of the data strobe signal is to act
      as a load command for the decoder to precisely designate the instant at
      which the incoming BCD data is to be interpreted.
PAR  Each of the output lines of decoder 142 is connected to a corresponding one
      of AND-gates 144. The other input of each AND-gate is supplied with the
      appropriate one of timing signals T1 through T12 to properly re-encode the
      decoder output into time-multiplexed form. Thus, for example, an incoming
      BCD digit on lines 44 which is decoded by decoder 142 as a 9 will cause a
      signal to appear on decoder output line 9. This signal is in turn supplied
      to AND-gate 144a which has its other input supplied with timing signal T6.
      The signal on output line 9 of decoder 142 will thus be gated through
      And-gate 144a at time T6. This signal will pass through Or-gate 146a to
      processor module 26 where it will be immediately converted back to BCD
      form for processing therein. In the same manner, if a BCD input character
      on lines 44 is interpreted by decoder 142 as having the value " 14",
      decoder output line 14 will supply a signal to And-gate 144n, This
      And-gate is also supplied with timing signal T12 and thus at time T12 and
      And-gate will pass a signal to the processor module through Or-gate 146b,
      where it will be decoded as a Recall Memory (RM) command.
PAR  As discussed in connection with the description of the internal keyboard
      construction shown in FIG. 4, keyboard output lines 18 are in reality
      three separate lines KB1, KB2 and KB3. These three lines contain all
      keyboard data in time-multiplexed form. The data on two of the three
      keyboard output lines, KB1 and KB2, is gated through the control center
      module to the display buffer section of the processor module via processor
      input lines 26. The keyboard output entering the control center module on
      line KB1-I is gated through Or-gate 146a to output line KB1-0, while
      keyboard output signals entering the control center module on line KB2-I
      are gated through Or-gate 146b to output line KB2-0. It will be seen that
      lines KB1-0 and KB2-0are collectively designated in FIG. 2 as lines 26.
PAR  Timing section 150 has two primary functions. First, it generates the
      necessary rotary dial and Touch-tone timing signals which are respectively
      supplied to rotary formatter 160 and Touch-tone encoder 170 over lines 152
      and 154. These timing signals are used within the rotary formatter and
      Touch-tone encoder to generate a rotary dial pulse putput on line 52 (FIG.
      2) or a Touch-tone output on line 50 which is compatible with the external
      telephone network environment.
PAR  The second function of timing section 150 is to provide a source of digit
      timing signals T1 through T12 within the control center module. In order
      to properly synchronize these timing signals with those generated within
      the processor module, a timing synchronization signal corresponding to T1
      is supplied to timing section 150 from the processor module over line 32
      (FIG. 2). The reconstituted digit timing signals T1 through T12 are
      generated in a 12 bit shift register 156 and are output over lines 158.
PAR  Finally, both the rotary/Touch-tone timing and digit timing subsections of
      timing section 150 are supplied with a basic clock frequency F.sub.o from
      the system clock 46. In the rotary and Touch-tone timing subsection of
      timing section 150, the basic clock frequency is supplied to a binary
      frequency dividing counter having outputs 152 and 154 at the appropriate
      stages. Thus, if F.sub.o is 25 KHZ, the arrangement shown in FIG. 5A will
      produce a basic rotary dial timing signal on line 152 at 100 HZ and a
      basic Touch-tone timing signal on line 154 at 10 HZ. The digit timing
      signals T1 - T12 generated in shift register 156 are supplied both to
      And-gates 144 in logic block 140 for re-encoding of BCD data from
      peripheral devices into time-multiplexed format and to function control
      block 200 for decoding and function sequencing within that unit.
PAR  Referring now to that portion of the control center module illustrated in
      FIG. 5B, the contents of the display buffer section of processor module 24
      is simultaneously supplied to display panel 16 and to the control center
      module over lines 28a and 28b respectively in seven segment form. Since
      all internal operations within the control center module, and specifically
      within function control block 200 therein, require data in BCD form, the
      seven segment display data must be initially converted to BCD after entry
      into the control center module. Seven segment information on input lines
      DS1 - DS5 and DEC (which collectively comprise lines 28b) are converted in
      BCD encoder-formatter 180 to four bit BCD characters which are in turn
      supplied to digit register 190 which serves as a four bit input buffer for
      the function control block 200.
PAR  Each time the function control circuitry outputs a load signal on line 192
      the contents of digit register 190 are replaced by the BCD analog of the
      character appearing on lines 28b from the display buffer section of the
      processor module. The particular digit in the display buffer is carried on
      output lines 28b at any instant will vary since the individual digits of
      the maximum possible twelve digits in the displayed number are
      sequentially and cyclically sampled by those lines. Consequently the
      appearance of the digit register load signal on lines 192 is timed by the
      circuitry within function control block 200 to successively load display
      digits into register 190 in decreasing order of significance, i.e. from
      left to right as appearing in display panel 16. Thus, when data in the
      processor module display buffer is processed within the control center
      module to produce either a Touch-tone or rotary dial output on lines 50
      and 52 respectively, or a BCD digit output on lines 54, the information
      will be handled within the control center module one digit at a time in
      decreasing order of significance in the case of numerical data, or from
      left to right in the case of a telephone number.
PAR  The internal design and operation of function control block 200 will be
      discussed below in connection with FIG. 6. At this point, however, the
      relationship of the function control block to the remainder of the control
      center module will be discussed with emphasis on its inputs and outputs.
PAR  In addition to receiving timing signals T1 through T12 on line 158 and a
      four bit BCD character from digit register 190 on lines 194, function
      control block 200 also receives the following additional inputs. External
      mode commands 48 (FIG. 2) designate various aspects of the environment in
      which the EBT functions. While in the disclosed embodiment these external
      mode commands are preselected during assembly of the EBT and are field
      modifiable, it will be appreciated that the mode commands could be entered
      via keyboard 14 and thus be under operator control. For example, depending
      on the condition of the rotary/Touch-tone select signal on line 202
      function control block 200 will output a signal on the appropriate one of
      either rotary enable output line 204 or Touch-tone enable output line 206.
      These signals are respectively supplied to rotary formatter 160 and
      Touch-tone encoder 170.
PAR  If the rotary enable signal is the active output from the function control
      block, rotary formatter 160 will convert the BCD digit appearing at
      function control output lines 208 into a properly shaped pulse train which
      is output on line 52. If, on the other hand, the rotary/Touch-tone select
      switch 202 is wired in Touch-tone position the active enable output from
      function control block 200 will be on Touch-tone enable line 206 which in
      turn causes Touch-tone encoder 170 to generate the appropriate 2 out of 8
      frequency code representing the digit on lines 208 and to output the digit
      in proper Touch-tone format over lines 50.
PAR  Function control block 200 is also provided with another optional
      preselected mode command on line 210 designated in FIG. 5B as Access
      Digit. This is used, for example, when the EBT operates in telephone mode
      in a "Centrex" environment commonly found in PBX/PABX installations. In a
      Centrex system outgoing calls to numbers external to the private branch
      exchange must be preceded with a particular predesignated digit, most
      commonly the digit 9. When the EBT is operating in a Centrex environment
      the function control circuitry will examine an entered telephone number to
      determine whether the prefix portion is present. This will be interpreted
      as an outgoing call rather than an intra-branch exchange call and the
      digit 9 (or any other desired digit) will be automatically impressed onto
      the number ahead of the prefix (or area code if present) and a suitable
      delay interval inserted between the access digit and telephone number for
      dial-tone acquisition.
PAR  Additional mode commands Pause On 1 and Pause On 2 respectively appearing
      in FIG. 5B on function control input lines 212 and 214 are used to
      designate whether the access code is one or two digits. Pause On 1 in
      combination with an AD command inserts the dial tone acquisition delay
      after the first digit in the telephone number supplied to the rotary or
      Touch-tone formatter and Pause On 2 causes the delay to occur after the
      second digit encountered.
PAR  Turning now to the outputs of function control block 200, as previously
      mentioned the four bit BCD character is output from the function control
      block over lines 208. These output lines also include a data valid (DAV)
      signal which indicates to rotary formatter 160, Touch-tone encoder 170 or
      EBT peripheral devices over lines 54 and bus 36 that the data being
      received has been analyzed and suitably modified by the function control
      circuitry in accordance with the external mode commands entering on lines
      48 and the keyboard function control commands input on line KB3.
PAR  Function control block 200 also outputs a timing pause signal T.sub.p on
      line 216 which is supplied to the inter-digit interval generator portion
      of rotary formatter 160. The pause signal is used in the rotary formatter
      to produce the necessary timing interval between the pulse groups
      representing each successive telephone number digit.
PAR  Signals representing Touch-tone keys * and No. are supplied by the function
      control block over lines 218 to the 2 out of 8 frequency encoder 172
      within Touch-tone encoder section 170. These two characters must be
      supplied to the Touch-tone encoder separately from the four-bit BCD
      character output from the function control block on lines 208 since these
      characters are not stored in the processor module display buffer or shown
      on the display panel. Thus, instead of being output from keyboard 14 on
      lines KB1 or KB2 and routed through the processor module 24 to BCD encoder
      180 and digit register 190 these signals are supplied directly from the
      keyboard to function control block 200 on line KB3 along with certain
      other telephone control commands not relevant to the display function,
      such as DIAL, SEND DATA and OP (see FIG. 4). As will be seen below in
      connection with FIG. 6 the * and No. characters supplied to function
      control block 200 on KB3 are decoded therein from time-multiplexed form
      and supplied to Touch-tone encoder section 170 over output lines 218.
PAR  FIG. 5B also shows an input to the function control block on line 220
      designated PND (present next digit). This signal originates from the
      output of the inter-digit interval generator portion of rotary formatter
      160 and is used to signify to the function control block that the next
      successive digit of the telephone number should be loaded into digit
      register 190 for analysis by the function control circuitry. The PND
      signal causes the timing section within the function control block to
      output a load signal on line 192 at a time when the next successive digit
      in the telephone number is appearing on lines 28b which are continuously
      sampling the individual digits of the number stored in the display buffer
      in a cyclical fashion.
PAR  It will be seen below that the function control circuitry within block 200
      operates on a two-phase cycle as follows. During phase A, the data
      analysis phase, the BCD coded digits of the number stored in the display
      buffer section of the processor module are sequentially examined under
      control of the keyboard function commands on KB3 and the various
      externally supplied mode commands on lines 48. During the second or data
      modification phase, phase B, the display digits are again sequentially
      input to the function control block and during this phase designated
      modifier digits are inserted into the BCD digit stream issuing from digit
      register 190 at appropriate positions or certain digits present in the
      data stream are suppressed and the so-modified number is output
      digit-serially over lines 208 along with the data valid signal, which
      represents that the data has been examined and placed in the proper form.
PAR  Turning now to the rotary formatter section 160 and Touch-tone encoder
      section 170, the application of the appropriate enabling signals 204 and
      206 from the function control block 200 have already been discussed. In
      addition to the enabling inputs the rotary formatter and Touch-tone
      encoder are provided with appropriate clock signals from timing section
      150. These timing frequencies are used to produce automatic dialing
      signals which are compatible with the external common carrier network. For
      example, rotary formatter 160 receives a 100 HZ signal from the timing
      section on line 152 while Touch-tone encoder 170 is supplied with a 10 HZ
      timing frequency on line 154.
PAR  In the rotary formatter on coincidence of a rotary enable signal on line
      204 and a data valid signal on lines 208a  at the input of And-gate 161
      the BCD digit on lines 208a will be gated through gated encoder 162 and
      loaded onto four-bit comparator 163. Comparator 163 is simultaneously
      supplied with the output from Mod 10 counter 164. The counter is
      incremented by clock pulses on line 165 until its count "B" which is
      supplied to comparator 163 matches the value "A" of the BCD digit from the
      function control block on lines 208a.
PAR  Each time the counter is incremented and its output B remains less than BCD
      digit value A the comparator outputs a signal to And-gate 166. And-gate
      166 is also supplied with the rotary enable-data valid coincidence signal
      and thus each time A is less than the new incremented value of B And-gate
      166 will supply an output signal to And-gate 167 and also, through an
      inverter, to And-gate 168. And-gate 167 also receives the output of 40/60
      duty cycle unit 169, which is supplied with the 100 HZ clock signal
      entering the rotary formatter on line 152.
PAR  The output of the 40/60 duty cycle unit 169 will thus be a pulse train
      having a period of 100 miliseconds with a 40 milisecond pulse width and a
      60 milisecond break. Application of this pulse train to And-gate 167
      together with the And-gate 166 output results in output of the comparator
      pulse suitably shaped from the rotary formatter over line 52. The same
      pulse output from And-gate 167 is supplied to counter 164 over line 165
      and increments the counter until a number of pulses equal to the numerical
      value of the BCD digit on lines 208 has been generated by the comparator
      and output on line 52, at which time A will equal B, the comparator will
      no longer supply a signal to And-gate 167, the output of 40/60 duty cycle
      generator 169 will no longer be gated to line 52 and the pulse train will
      terminate.
PAR  At this point the inter-digit interval logic is activated by coincidence of
      input signals at And-gate 168. The counter arrangement within the
      inter-digit interval section will generate a PND output signal only after
      10 pulse break times, or an inter-digit interval of 600 miliseconds, has
      elapsed. After this inter-digit interval application of a PND signal to
      function control block 200 will cause the next display digit to be loaded
      into digit register 190 and the next successive digit of the modified
      telephone number will be supplied to the rotary formatter over lines 208a.
      Finally, timing pause signal T.sub.p is supplied to the inter-digit
      interval logic over line 216 and causes a dial tone acquisition delay to
      be generated between an access digit and the telephone number itself. As
      will be described, T.sub.p is generated by the function control timing
      circuitry in response to the presence of AD command in combination with
      either Pause On 1 or Pause On 2 commands.
PAR  Touch-tone encoder 170 receives the BCD digit from function control block
      200 over lines 208b. In addition coincidence of a data valid signal on
      lines 208b and a Touch-tone enable signal on line 206 causes And-gate 171
      to provide a signal to one input of And-gate 173. The other input of
      And-gate 173 is connected to the output of 60/40 duty cycle unit 174 which
      is supplied with the 10 HZ clock signal from timing section 150 on line
      154. Coincidence of these inputs at And-gate 173 will enable 2 out of 8
      frequency encoder 172 to convert the BCD digit appearing on lines 208b
      into Touch-tone format having the proper characteristics.
PAR  Referring now to FIG. 6 the internal logic design and operation of function
      control block 200 will now be discussed.
PAR  As previously mentioned the circuitry within function control block 200
      operates on the BCD digit contained in digit register 190 in accordance
      with a two-phase cycle including data analysis (phase A) and data
      modification (phase B). During the analysis phase the BCD digits
      successively loaded into digit register 190 in response to a load signal
      on line 192 from the timing circuits within function control block 200 are
      tested in accordance with certain function control commands from the
      keyboard and external preselected mode commands.
PAR  For example, keyboard output line KB3 supplies certain telephone function
      control commands in time-multiplexed form such as DIAL, OP, SEND DATA,
      etc. (see FIG. 4) directly to function control block 200. These KB3
      signals are decoded from time-multiplexed form by function decoding logic
      230 which is also supplied with timing signals T1 through T12 from the
      function control timing section 150 on lines 158.
PAR  In addition, as was seen in connection with FIG. 4, KB3 also carries
      various peripheral control signals supplied to the keyboard from
      peripheral devices through bus 36 and line 120. Function decoding logic
      230 decodes the KB3 signals and supplies them to the various data
      evaluation and modification circuitry shown in the lower half of function
      control block 200 in FIG. 6. In addition, function decoding block 230
      provides the decoded signals representing the * and No. characters to
      Touch-tone encoder section 170, over lines 218, as previously discussed in
      connection with FIG. 5B.
PAR  During phase A the BCD digits loaded into digit register 190 are examined
      by the function control circuitry to be described below in sequence and
      certain digit insertion or blanking flags are set in response to the
      examination. During the data modification phase the number is again loaded
      into register 190 in digit serial fashion and the digit insertion and
      blanking flags set in the preceding phase cause the displayed number to be
      output with certain digits inserted in the digit stream or certain digits
      of the number suppressed.
PAR  Timing circuitry within the function control block supplies a load signal
      on line 192 to digit register 190 at proper times so that successive
      digits of the number in the display buffer are sequentially examined
      during phase A and gated through the function control block during phase B
      in appropriately modified form, even though the display digit sampled by
      lines 28b is rapidly changing cyclic fashion. The digit insertion and
      blanking flags within function control block 200 operate on the BCD digit
      stream entering the function control block on lines 194 to produce a
      modified digit stream leaving the function control block on lines 208 in
      the following manner.
PAR  AD flag 240 receives the following inputs. External mode command Ad on line
      210 designates that the EBT is operating within a Centrex-type network and
      that all outside telephone calls are to be automatically preceded with a
      certain preselected digit typically the digit 9. A keyboard function
      control command appearing on line KB3 at time T2 is interpreted by
      function decoding logic 230 as a Dial signal which is in turn supplied to
      AD flag 240. Presence of the Dial signal indicates that the digit stream
      appearing on lines 194 is a telephone number.
PAR  Finally, timing signals T5 through T7 are supplied to AD flag 240 and cause
      the flag circuitry to interrogate the digit stream on lines 194 at times
      T5 - T7. If digits are encountered during this interval (and the Ad and
      Dial inputs are also present) the AD flag will interpret the digits as a
      telephone prefix and the flag will be set indicating that during phase B
      the digit 9 (or any other preselected one or two digit access code) should
      be inserted in the digit stream output from the function control block on
      lines 208 ahead of the prefix (or the area code if present). The AD flag
      DAV (data valid) output will remain inactive during phase A and thus
      insure that the digit appearing on lines 194 will not be gated to the
      function control output by data gate 250 during the examination phase.
PAR  Digit blanking flag 242 is used to cause a sign or decimal character
      appearing on lines 194 to be suppressed or not depending on whether
      peripheral devices which are to receive the data are equipped to handle
      decimal and sign characters. For example, a keyboard function control
      command appearing on line KB3 at time T8 will be interpreted by function
      decoding logic 230 as a SAD (signal and decimal enable) signal indicating
      that the receiving peripheral should receive the sign or decimal character
      unaltered. This SAD signal was supplied to the keyboard from the receiving
      peripheral 118 over line 120 (see (FIG. 4). The SAD output of function
      decoding logic 230 is applied to sign and decimal blanking flag 242 and
      its presence indicates the character on lines 194 should not be
      suppressed.
PAR  Similarly, s aignal on KB3 at time T3 will be decoded by logic 230 as a
      Send Data signal either from the keyboard or from a requesting peripheral
      device. Application of the Send Data command signal to sign and decimal
      blanking flag 242 will indicate that the character appearing on lines 194
      is a decimal character and not a telephone number digit. The sign and
      decimal blanking flag is so arranged that if the Send Data input is
      present but the SAD input is not, the flag will be set and during the data
      modification phase the sign and decimal characters will be suppressed in
      the digit stream output on lines 208. This is accomplished by inhibiting
      the DAV output which would normally be active during phase B at the
      corresponding location in the digit stream.
PAR  Finally, NZ (non zero) flag 246 is used to insert zeros into the digit
      stream on lines 194 at those digit locations where no data is present.
      This is used when the receiving peripherals require fixed word input
      having a predesignated number of digits. NZ flag 246 is enabled by the
      presence of LZS (unsuppress leading zeros) which enters the function
      control block on line KB3 at time T7 and is decoded by function decoding
      logic 230. LZS signal originates from the receiving peripheral 118 (FIG.
      4) which supplies it to the keyboard over lines 120. When this input is
      present NZ flag 270 will be set and during phase B a sequence of zeros
      will be inserted into the digit stream ahead of the first digit to fill
      out the fixed word format.
PAR  The digit timing circuitry within function control block 200 is shown in
      FIG. 6 just below the digit insertion and blanking flags 240, 242 and 246.
      This timing section controls generation of the digit load signal supplied
      on line 192 to digit register 190 in response to the following status
      inputs describing the EBT operating mode: rotary/Touchtone select input on
      line 202 indicating telephone operation; and RFD and SEND DATA inputs on
      KB3 decoded by function decoding logic 230 indicating data terminal
      operation. The timing section also receives the PND (present next digit)
      signal on line 220 from the output of the inter-digit interval portion of
      rotary formatter 160 (FIG. 5B). Finally, the timing section receives
      preselected mode commands Pause On 1 and Pause On 2 on lines 212 and 214
      respectively. These latter commands cause the function control timing
      circuitry to output a T.sub.p (pause) signal after either a 1 or 2 digit
      access code when AD flag 240 is set. This T.sub.p signal is supplied to
      the inter-digit interval generating portion of rotary formatter 160 and
      used therein to halt the dialing pulse output after the access code in
      order to insure outside line dial tone acquisition.
PAR  The digit timing circuitry within function control block 200 is arranged to
      operate either synchronously or asynchronously depending on the condition
      of the various status inputs. For example, asynchronous scan flag 250
      receives the PND, RFD and rotary select inputs indicating asynchronous
      operation while synchronous scan flag 252 receives the SEND DATA and
      Touch-tone select inputs indicating synchronous operation.
PAR  Thus, if the EBT is operating in either rotary telephone mode (rotary
      select input present) or in data transmission mode and a requesting
      peripheral device requires asynchronous input (RFD present) then upon
      receipt of a PND signal either from the rotary formatter on line 220 or
      from the requesting peripheral on line KB3, asynchronous scan flag 250
      will be set and the digit loading sequence in register 190 will occur in
      an asynchronous manner upon receipt of a PND signal by the timing
      circuitry which in turn produces a digit load signal on line 192.
      Similarly, if the EBT is operating in Touch-tone telephone mode
      (Touch-tone selection input present) or is transmitting data to a
      peripheral device which can receive synchronous data input (Send Data
      input present) then synchronous scan flag 252 will be set and the digit
      load signals on line 192 will occur synchronously.
PAR  Superimposed on this general synchronous/asynchronous scheme is the
      provision for a fixed interval delay after predesignated digits in a
      telephone number response to the presence of an AD command in combination
      with either Pause On 1 or Pause On 2 commands which indicate a centrex or
      tieline environment wherein after a 1 or 2 digit access code a dial tone
      must be acquired before the outgoing number is dialed.
PAR  Timing circuitry 254 provides the described synchronous/asynchronous
      generation of digit load signals as follows. The inter-digit delay portion
      of timing circuit 254 outputs an incrementing pulse to scan digit position
      counter 256 after a predesignated time interval has elapsed from receipt
      of the asynchronous scan flag signal. In a similar manner the 10 HZ
      Touch-tone rate clock portion of timing circuits 254 will provide a
      synchronous counter incrementing signal to scan digit position counter 256
      in response to the output of synchronous scan flag 252. Finally, the
      access dial tone wait portion of timing circuit 254 generates 1 of 2
      outputs depending on whether the EBT is operating in rotary telephone or
      Touch-tone telephone mode. Specifically, in rotary mode the access dial
      tone circuitry will generate a T.sub.p signal after the access digit. This
      signal is supplied to the inter-digit interval portion of rotary formatter
      160 and causes an appropriate delay in the pulse output therefrom as
      described above. In telephone mode the dial tone acquisition circuitry
      will appropriately delay the incrementing signal for scan digit position
      counter 256.
PAR  Scan digit position counter 256 is a two-phase counter which steps through
      the twelve digit times once during phase A and once during phase B in
      response to incrementing signals from either the inter-digit delay,
      Touch-tone rate clock or dial tone acquisition delay portions of timing
      circuits 254. The counter output representing the digit time of the
      current contents of digit register 190 is combined with timing signals T1
      through T12 in timing select circuit 258. This results in a digit load
      output on line 192 at a time when the next successive digit to be
      interrogated or processed is determined to be on digit buffer input lines
      182 (FIG. 5B). This synchronization is necessary since as described above
      the particular display digit appearing on lines 28b and thus lines 182 is
      continuously cycling through the 12 possible display digit positions.
PAR  During phase B counter 256 provides an output designated in FIG. 6 as .phi.
      B. This counter output is supplied to one input of And-gate 260, the other
      input of which receives the digit load signal from timing select circuit
      258 on line 192. Thus, And-gate 260 will be enabled at each digit load
      time during the data modification phase. The output from And-gate 260 is
      supplied to one input of And-gate 262 the other input of which receives
      the data valid signal (DAV) from the digit insertion and blanking flags
      240, 242, and 246. These flags are arranged so that the data valid output
      is inactive during phase A. Moreover, as previously discussed, the DAV
      output from sign and decimal blanking flag 242 is also inactive during
      phase B whenever a suppressed decimal or sign is encountered in the digit
      stream on lines 194.
PAR  Thus, it is seen that And-gate 262 will be enabled if at all only during
      phase B. The output of And-gate 262 represents the gating of the data
      valid signal to the output of function control block 200 during the data
      modification phase in synchronism with generation of the digit register
      load signal on line 192. In addition, the output of And-gate 262 is
      supplied to the select input of data gate 250 which also receives two
      four-bit BCD digit inputs. The first digit input on lines 194 represents
      the contents of digit register 190 while the second input carries the
      output from code generating matrix 248. Code generating matrix 248 is in
      turn supplied with the Force 9 output of AD flag 240 and the Force 0
      output of NZ flag 246. The significance of these outputs has already been
      discussed. Code generating matrix 248 also receives an input in the form
      of the Operator (OP) function control command decoded from keyboard line
      KB3. The Operator summons command is interpreted by code generating matrix
      248 as being identical to the Force 0 output of NZ flag 246.
PAR  Code generating matrix 248 provides an output to data gate 250 in the form
      of either a 0 or 9 digit in four bit BCD format for insertion into the
      digit stream on lines 194 depending on whether it represents an access
      digit, an Operator summons or is required to fill-out a number for fixed
      word transmission.
PAR  Thus, the overall effect of the phase B function control operation is that
      the digit stream appearing on lines 194 will be gated through data gate
      250 to output lines 208 with certain modifications in the form of 0 and 9
      digit insertion or digit suppression of sign and decimal characters.
PAR  FIG. 7 depicts in schematic fashion the principle of operation of
      articulated display module 40 and its interconnection with display panel
      16.
PAR  Timing signals T1 through T12 are supplied to articulated display module 40
      on input timing lines 38 also shown in FIG. 2. A typical telephone number
      including area code, prefix and suffix is shown at the top of FIG. 7 in
      non-articulated format -- i.e. compressed to the right as stored in the
      display buffer section of processor module 22. The individual digits of
      the telephone number are illustrated in association with the corresponding
      timing signal input lines 38.
PAR  When mode switch 42 is actuated in its position corresponding to
      articulated display presentation certain of the input timing signals on
      lines 38 corresponding to the individual digits of the compressed
      telephone number are shifted within module 40 to different timing output
      lines 43 as follows. The suffix portion of the telephone number -- in this
      case 4757 -- passes through display module 40 unaltered and exits on the
      same timing lines T9 through T12. The timing signals T6 - T8 corresponding
      to the prefix digits 397 on the other hand are each shifted one timing
      line to the right and exit from the display module 40 on timing lines T5
      -T7. This results in a one digit spacing between the prefix and suffix of
      the telephone number as displayed. Similarly, the timing signals
      corresponding to the area code 415 on lines T3 - T5 are shifted two timing
      lines to the left and exit from display module 40 on timing lines T1 - T3
      inserting one digit space between the area code and prefix.
PAR  The segmented digit timing signals derived as above are supplied to the
      digit select inputs of display panel 16 and control the placement of the
      individual display digits within the panel. The seven-segment signals
      representing the display digits (including the decimal character) are
      supplied in timed digit sequence to display panel 16 over lines 28 from
      the display buffer section of the processor module and are routed to the
      appropriate seven-segment display location (e.g. Nixie tube) by the digit
      select line which is then active. It will be appreciated that when mode
      switch 42 is in its non-articulation position the digit select timing
      signals on input lines 38 leave display module 40 on the same lines and
      cause the digits supplied to panel 16 to be displayed as stored in the
      display buffer.
PAR  It will be seen that implementation of the display articulation approach
      represented by FIG. 7 results in fixed articulated display of an entered
      telephone number. The term fixed indicates that as the telephone number is
      entered one digit at a time via keyboard 14 and serially loaded into the
      display buffer within processor module 30 it is simultaneously displayed
      on display panel 16 such that the individual digits move from right to
      left thereon until the entire number is displayed. However, as the entered
      telephone number moves from right to left across the display panel the
      displayed segmenting blanks between suffix and prefix and between prefix
      and area code will remain fixed with respect to the display positions.
      This results in a situation wherein the entered telephone number is not
      easily verified visually until the entire number has been entered. A more
      desirable approach is to have the blanks move along with the entered
      number in their final position relative thereto as the number moves from
      right to left on the display. Such a fully automatic articulation approach
      must take into account the following situations if improper grouping
      during entry (and after complete entry) is to be avoided:
PAR  1. Operater Assisted Calls (OAC)
PAR  OAC involves entering one or more leading digits (such as 0) before dialing
      the telephone number to be called. This may be accomplished as described
      in detail below in connection with FIG. 8 by examining the first two digit
      entries following a dial command and comparing them against stored
      constants representing local operator assist codes (typically 0, 1, 01 and
      10). If an operator code is found, articulation will be delayed until the
      end of the operator code.
PAR  2. Exchange Environment
PAR  In a PABX environment one or more access digits must be dialed to access
      outside lines prior to dialing the called subscriber's number. In a
      multi-level network environment several sets of access digits may precede
      the basic number. In a centrex environment a complete address may comprise
      a total of only four digits. In the present invention means are provided
      for counting the number of digits before a dial-out command is given. If
      the number of digits is three or less the articulation process will be
      delayed until the next series of digits are entered.
PAR  After operator code and exchange access digits are verified, means are
      provided at the start of an articulation process to detect the entry of
      the fifth digit, whereupon, the first three digits are shifted left by two
      digit positions to obtain a 3-2 grouping. Upon detection of the eighth
      digit the first six digits are shifted left by two positions to obtain a
      3-3-2 grouping. At all other times each digit is shifted left without
      rearranging the original contents of the display register other than a
      single position left shift.
PAR  3. Conservation of display upon overflow
PAR  In the event of display overflow of an articulated number it is desirable
      to provide means for disabling articulation (i.e., shifting to
      non-articulated display mode) so that final overflow will occur only when
      all display positions are loaded with numeric information. This is
      achieved in the present invention by inclusion of means for examining the
      most significant digit (MSD) for overflow while in articulation. Upon
      overflow detection means are provided to shift all digits right until all
      blanks are "squeezed out".
PAR  4. Editing
PAR  In the event of an entry error, editing -- i.e., backspace correction --
      without deviating from basic articulation format is a desirable feature.
      In other words, the articulation process should be completely reversible.
      This is accomplished by the provision of means for clearing the display
      shift register each time the backspace key is actuated. Following a
      backspace command, operator code and exchange access digits are verified
      and the articulation process is repeated. By counting the contents of the
      display shift register each non-vacant position is treated as a digit
      entry command to the articulation means.
PAR  5. Interim deviation from format during entry
PAR  In an ideal articulation scheme the components of a phone number are
      strictly articulated as the digits are keyed in. In less than ideal
      schemes, the correct articulation is available only after the entire
      number is entered. This is what has been described as "floating" versus
      fixed articulation. Examples of the fixed articulation approach are: fixed
      articulation locations as in FIG. 7, and no articulation until some final
      command such as dial is initiated. In either case, ease of verification
      and correction during entry is sacrificed.
PAR  Assuming floating articulation is desired, some deviation from perfect
      articulation is unavoidable. For example, a common grouping of 3-4 (prefix
      plus suffix) is not a subset of an equally common grouping of 3-3-4 (area
      code plus prefix plus suffix).
PAR  An intelligent articulation scheme is necessary to eliminate both user
      forethought and custom field installation and still provide optimum format
      conformance for any combination of the situations listed above.
      Unavoidable interim deviation is limited to a single digit which is
      under-articulated but forgiven on the next entry. For example, the first
      four digits of a common seven digit number are entered under-articulated
      as contiguous digits (4), rather than a correct (3-1) grouping.
      Articulation starts on the fifth digit to obtain a postponed but correct
      interim grouping of (3-2). However, in the case of a four digit centrex
      address, an unforgiven over-articulated (3-1) grouping display is avoided
      by the above compromise.
PAR  One specific implementation of these design objectives will now be
      discussed in connection with FIG. 8. The numeric information entered via
      keyboard 14 is stored in the output section of the display buffer of
      processor module 24 (see FIG. 2). The information is then supplied (in
      seven segment form) over line 28a to the display articulation logic 40.
      The digit-serial signals on line 28a enter display shift register 310 via
      a shift control unit 312 and are constantly recirculated through the shift
      register and shift control. Shift control 312 performs the various
      shifting functions -- i.e., shift right, shift left, or insert blank. Each
      time a new digit is entered the display is shifted one position to the
      left and the new digit is entered into the least significant digit (LSD)
      position.
PAR  The first two digits after a blank display are interrogated by Leading 0/1
      latch 314. If the leading digit is not a 0 or a 1, articulation counter
      316 is enabled and starts counting every digit. When the first five digits
      are counted the fifth digit is decoded and blank insert unit 318 instructs
      shift control 312 to insert a blank between the third and fourth digits.
      When the eighth digit is entered and decoded, blank insert unit 318 again
      transmits a blank shift command to shift control 312 and this time the
      blank is inserted between the sixth and seventh digits. When the
      thirteenth digit is inserted a signal from the display indicates that the
      MSD position is filled and all the blanks are then removed compressing the
      number.
PAR  When the first digit is a 0 or a 1, articulate counter 316 is disabled. If
      the first two digits are either 01 or 10, the articulate counter remains
      disabled. Upon receipt of the next digit, the articulate counter is
      enabled to resume its normal operation. The following tables illustrate
      several examples of floating articulation in operation.
