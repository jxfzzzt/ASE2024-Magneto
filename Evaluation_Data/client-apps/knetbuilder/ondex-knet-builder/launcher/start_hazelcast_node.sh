# WARNING: We're not using this anymore!

# Hazelcast node launcher script for use with the distributed memory
# implementation of an ONDEX graph. You can use this script to start
# Hazelcast data nodes on different machines in order to spread large
# ONDEX graphs over the resources of a cluster of machines.
#
# Please ensure that you use the same ondex-hazelcast.xml configuration
# file on every machine in the cluster. If you wish to run more than one
# ONDEX instance on a cluster of machines at the same time, then you will
# need to set an appropriate cluster name, username and password in this
# configuration file.
#
# By default, this script starts a Hazelcast data node with 1GB of RAM.
# You can customise the amount of RAM assigned to Hazelcast by altering
# the variable below.
