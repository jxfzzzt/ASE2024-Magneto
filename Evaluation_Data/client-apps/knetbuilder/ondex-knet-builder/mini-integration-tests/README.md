# ONDEX Workflow Engine Tests

This module performs integration tests running the workflow engine against test data and using test workflows. 

After the workflow execution results (e.g., and OXL or a file in another format, generated by an exporter) are
reloaded by the tests, to verify expected results.

Have a look at the [sources](src/test/java) for details.
